# Transcript
Participant number 17 - Female, 20, Newham

Interviewer: Okay, um. Can we start by talking about what you’ve put first please.

Interviewee: Right, for my first picture, I’ve just drawn a person by their self.

Interviewer: Mhm

Interviewee: Do you want me to say why I’ve drawn it?

Interviewer: Yeah, can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Right, I’ve drawn it because I feel like loneliness is when you’re by yourself and you’re not around any friends or family. It’s literally just you by yourself. Um. And the second one-

Interviewer: Before we go onto the second one [Interviewee: go on], I’m going to ask you some questions about the first one.

Interviewee: Alright.

Interviewer: So when you say that um… so you’re saying that basically loneliness is when you’re by yourself, there’s no other people, you have no other friends-

Interviewee: Yeah, and you’re lonely. You’ve like got no one to turn to, no one to talk to. Or you like, sometimes you might even actually have people around you, but you feel lonely within yourself, that you can’t turn to other people or things like that, if you get what I’m saying.

Interviewer: When you say lonely within yourself [interviewee: yeah], can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like, you’re just feeling down, maybe you’ve had a bad day, maybe something’s happened throughout your day that makes you feel like that.

Interviewer: When you say, um, like you’ve had a bad day, or something happened, can you tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Um… sometimes you can just wake up on the wrong side of the bed, or like, that’s just what I say, meaning like you wake up and nothing at all could affect you, you literally just feel like you’re having a bad day. Maybe it’s like in your mind. Erm… but yeah, so other things, you could wake up and actually be happy, and something will happen throughout that day that makes you like quite sad. Just like little things. Do you want me to explain like what things?

Interviewer: Um, I mean sure.

Interviewee: Erm… so, if you’ve got ready and you’re going out with your mates and it like, it starts raining, or like, just little things, if you’re having a bad day

Interruption

Interviewee: Yeah, I was talking about, like, if you’ve woke up, and you’ve had an argument with someone, that obviously may make your day worser than it was. [Interviewer: mm] Just little things, missing your bus or stepping in a puddle, and it just like puts you down a little bit.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Obviously you’ll be quite sad. And yeah, if you’re lonely then it’s even worse. Like, just being sad by yourself is alright. But if you’ve got people around you to cheer you up, it makes you better. But if you’re like sad, and you’re by yourself, like if you lonely and you’re by yourself it’s even worse, kind of thing.

Interviewer: When you say like being by yourself and its worse, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Well if you’ve got people to talk to, it might brighten up your mood, go out do things to keep you active to not think about your sadness or your loneliness. But if you’re by yourself, you’re literally by yourself, so whatever’s on your mind, it’s- you’re gonna be thinking about it, because you can do things by yourself to oc- like occupy yourself but when you’re in a bad mood it’s better to be around people that cheer you up and make you happy.

Interviewer: Mm. So when you say around good people and to cheer you up, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, just like hang out with friends or family, go do things. Even if you’re just sitting there talking to them about your problems and why you feel lonely and things like that.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay. Can we talk about what you’ve put first- sorry, second, please?

Interviewee: So the phone. When you’re lonely, I feel like you go on like social media or things like that, and you see other people and they’re like looking happy or things like that, but, most people don’t really post their lonely moments or their sad moments on Instagram, so when you’re looking at other people you’re like oh, they’re so happy and things like that, when realistically they’re probably not even as happy as they seem to be kind of thing, they’re- obviously people go through different, do you know what I mean? If you’re sad, you’re not going to post a picture of like you sad, you’re gonna do it when you’re happy and you’re smiling and all of your mates are in the room, like having a good time kind of thing.

Interviewer: Mm. And when you see, for example, other people on social media, erm, you know, showing that they’re having a good time, [interviewee: yeah] how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Well if you’re sad and you’re lonely and you’ve got no one to talk to, then I feel like it makes you feel kind of worse. Not worse, but it does a little bit, because you’re like… you’re sad, you’re lonely, you’ve got nothing to do, you just feel like everything’s going so wrong, but when you look at them and they’re all happy and their living this perfect- like it literally looks like this perfect little life that they’re living, but it’s not really a perfect life, if you know what I mean? Like, no one’s gonna post their failures or their bad times on social media. So, it’s just like, it’s like… it’s like kind of fake. Not fake but, it is a little bit, if you know what I mean.

Interviewer: When you say fake, erm, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, like, someone could literally post a picture of them being so happy, and all for social media, all for likes and for followers, and within theirself they, they might not even be feeling that happy. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Mhm. So if- [interviewee: so like] Sorry.

Interviewee: Go on.

Interviewer: No no, go on.

Interviewee: No, go on, it’s alright.

Interviewer: Erm, so when you say they might not be feeling happy inside, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Well, some people like put on a front. So, you could be happy and bubbly on the outside, but inside you never, like other people for example, say you’re seeing someone, they’re happy, they’re smiling, they’re laughing, they’re joking, but deep down inside you don’t know how they feel. Same with you and other people, so like right now, I could be smiling, I could be so happy, but deep down you don’t actually know what’s going on inside my mind, or within my body kind of thing, do you know what I mean? [Interviewer: mm] So yeah.

Interviewer: Um, okay. And… so what you’re saying is that, people on social media can put on, like a different image to what they’re-

Interviewee: Actually going through [Interviewer: feeling] or feeling, yeah.

Interviewer: Um, and they’re… okay. And how do you feel about that.

Interviewee: Um… Mm, I don’t really, I don’t really feel anything about it, I don’t know. Like, it’s like… I dunno? It’s like, kind of like, fake? I feel like, that’s why I’ve come back to the word fake, I feel like it’s kind of fake, because you, you’re looking at these people and you’re thinking oh they have a perfect little life but realistically they don’t, do you know what I mean? So, you might think, oh yeah they’re doing this and they’re doing that but realistically, they might be so sad and so unhappy about their life and themselves. [Interviewer: Mm] But yeah.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: No problem. Thank you. Um, can you talk about what you’ve put next please?

Interviewee: Yeah, I’ve put rain. And I feel like rain is kind of dark, gloomy weather kind of thing. Like, if you’re like, I dunno. It just reminds me of sad times, like, well if the sun’s out, people are more happy and people are more going on, you’re more out doing things. But, when it’s raining, you don’t want to go out, you just want to stay indoors, you don’t really want to socialise, like, you’re literally just by yourself, like, do you know what I mean? If you’re indoors, unless you’re with your mates indoors, but, if not, then you’re just by yourself when it’s raining, do you know what I mean? I feel like the rain is quite… not nice weather, so it might make people sad as well.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Mm… I don’t know, makes me feel like, you don’t really do a lot when it’s raining, so you’re literally just sitting there. And it can get quite lonely when you are sitting there. Where if the sun’s out, you get up early, you’re in your summer dress, you go do something. Where, when it’s raining, it’s more like… like bad mood, kind of thing.

Interviewer: When you say you were… you wanna be inside, and and chill inside, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, ‘cause obviously you don’t want to go out if it’s raining, so when you’re inside, you’re literally just sitting inside, there ain’t really a lot to do when you’re indoors. Like, you can watch telly, you can go on your phone, but that’s literally gonna get boring soon, do you know what I mean? There’s only so much telly you can watch, there’s only so much you can be on your phone before you start getting distracted, and then you’re like sitting there, and then you get agitated because you’re like, what can I do, where can I go, and you look at the weather and it’s just like, ugh. So, yeah.

Interviewer: Um, when you say that, you know, um, you can only watch so much telly, or go on your phone for so long, and then you start getting bored, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, like… I don’t… where I, I’ll sit there and I’ll watch telly, and I’ll sit there and go on my phone, but I feel like, there’s only so much you should do of that. Like, when you’re sitting in your house every day on your phone and watching telly all the time, then I feel like there’s something wrong with you, because you should actually go out, you should actually socialise and interact with people, instead of just… being by yourself in your room, doing what, doing what you do, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Er… I don’t really know. Because sometimes I do like to chill indoors and I do like to sit there and go on my phone and watch telly, but I do also like to go out and go do things with my mates and interact with other people, which is good. Because I feel like if you just sit indoors all day you’ll end up driving yourself crazy, kind of thing, like ‘cause you don’t really have a lot to do… but yeah, that’s about it.

Interviewer: When you say driving yourself crazy, [Interviewee: Mm] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: It’s just like, a bit of a, a bit of a saying I feel like, like when people say oh, you’re gonna drive yourself crazy, where if you’re sitting and thinking about the same thing or, not doing nothing, or going round the same thing like over in circles kind of thing, you’re gonna end up driving yourself crazy with that thing, or what you’re doing, kind of thing. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: When you say going circles, [Interviewee: yeah] tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like, when you’re going round and round, like same thing, like… mmm how can I put that into words? Like, if you’ve got the same problem, and it keeps occurring again and again and again, where it’s the same problem, you’re like going round and round in circles with the same problem? You should have the problem once, and get the problem out of the way and carry on, kind of thing. You shouldn’t have to keep worrying and going around in circles. Do you get what I mean?

Interviewer: Um… when you say that, you’ve got to get rid of the problem and then… can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, like, if something is bringing you down in life, or you’re going over the same thing, you shouldn’t do that. You should literally get rid of what’s bothering you or what’s bringing your problem, and move on to being happy within your life, because you only get one life, and it’s short as well, so you don’t know what’s going to happen.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is, when you’re home alone, and when you’ve got to- when you watch TV or go on your phone [Interviewee: Yeah], you feel like that’s the time when you go round and round.

Interviewee: Yeah, with that and with other things, kind of thing, do you know what I mean? It’s not just a phone situation, just things in general life, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Like, it can be, it can be to do with your phone, it can, like anything. Like family situations, friendship situations, situations with you and yourself. Like, you shouldn’t have to keep going over the same thing. Wherever you wanna move forward from it… or you don’t, kind of thing. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is, um, when you’re at home, [Interviewee: mm] and... so when you’re at home, and you know, you can’t go out ‘cause it’s raining, then you end up watching telly, or go on your phone, and that’s the time when you find yourself going around and [Interviewee: round, yeah] round, thinking back and forward about

Interviewee: And you’re not doing nothing, yeah. If you’re just sitting there by yourself, yeah. [Interviewer:… about…] About anything, yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And… and that’s associated with loneliness, the fact that you’re going around, thinking about an issue-

Interviewee: Yeah, that you shouldn’t be, yeah. And sometimes, if you’ve got people around you to talk to you about the situation, then it’s good. But if you ain’t, and you’re isolating yourself, and you’re lonely, because you’re by yourself or you feel like, well I can’t actually go and speak to anyone about this situation, do you know what I mean? That’s when you keep going round and you shouldn’t do that. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Mm. Um… tell me more about telly.

Interviewee: What about it?

Interviewer: ‘Cause you talked about social media [Interviewee: Yeah.] and your phone.

Interviewee: So, telly is like, I feel like you should watch a certain amount of telly a day, like maybe like watch a series, or watch and episode or watch your favourite thing, like your favourite movie, but, I don’t feel like it’s healthy within yourself, to sit there in front of the telly of hours. Like, motivate yourself a little bit to do other things, ‘cause when you’re isolating yourself, obviously when you’re sitting there by yourself watching telly for hours and hours and hours upon days, that’s when you will become lonely, become isolated within yourself. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Well, I don’t do it personally, but other people, I feel like it could be quite sad. Do you know what I mean? Like, if I am lonely, I will… I will try to go out with my friends. I know if I sit there and watch telly and doce- and chill all day and be lazy, then I know that I’m gonna feel worse about myself. If I feel lonely, I feel sad, I should get up, get ready, go out and try talk to my mates, try do things, but obviously sometimes you can’t, ‘cause you feel like maybe you’re just being funny within yourself, or maybe you feel like you can’t talk to your mates about your problems, and what’s going on in your life. Obviously that’s when you’re sitting and you’re gonna isolate yourself. But, sitting in for a day or two until I feel better, I won’t sit like for hours, I will do things, do you know what I mean? But, yeah.

Interviewer: And you said being funny with yourself, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like, I felt like I was meant to say when your friends are being funny with you. So like… it’s like, kind of thing where if you feel like, some of your mates, and you have good frienships with some of your mates and some of your family, but some of them you feel like, you don’t really know in your head. Do you know… so, you don’t really know, sometimes you might get mixed emotions or mixed feelings for them that might make you feel some type of way. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Tell me more about those feelings.

Interviewee: Like… sometimes you just get like bad vibes off people, maybe because they’re not in the mood or they’re lonely or something’s going on in their life, they might take it out on you. But that’s just a feeling, they might not actually feel like that towards you, they might actually love you and like be there for you. But when they’re in a bad place, they’ll just like take it out on the people that are close to them kind of thing.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Quite sad really, because I feel like if one of my mates or one of my family or friends was in a bad mood, I would actually want them to come to me, so I could like boost them up, the same way that I would want to feel comfortable towards them. But sometimes you just don’t. Some people would rather be by themself and rather be lonely. But I feel like, me as a friend, if my friend or my family or someone was sad, I would like like them to come to me because I would like to be able to cheer them up and get them out of that bad mood. Try and shake it off and make them happy again kind of thing.

Interviewer: You also mentioned that you can’t always talk to your friends. [Interviewee: Yeah.] Tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like, sometimes you can’t actually talk to your friends about what’s going on in your life, because you feel like they might not understand you or they might judge you or they might talk about you or things like that, do you know what I mean? So sometimes it is better to keep things to yourself that happen. But yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is sometimes it’s better to keep things inside you and not actually share it [Interviewee: Share it out, yeah] with any of your friends because you know, they may judge you [Interviewee: Might judge you, yeah]. Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Some people are different, just as people, do you know what I mean? Some people, if something happens to them, someone might say yeah, I’m gonna retaliate to it. Some others might not retaliate to it, do you know what I mean? So everyone’s literally different in their own little ways. Like some people have been brought up different, some people are just different, the way they think, the way they act, the way they talk, the way they are, general. Everyone’s different, do you know what I mean? So, some people might judge you for doing something you’ve done because they might not have done- they might never do that. They might think that you’re a bad person for doing… do you know what I mean? Or like a situation happening or something’s happened, and the way that you retaliate to it, they might not agree with, do you know what I mean? Or they might say oh, why didn’t you retaliate? ‘Cause you’re like, well, maybe I can’t be bothered. And then they’re like oh, you’re weird, because the way that you’ve acted about it. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is um… you care about what other people think of you.

Interviewee: No, not really care. [Interviewer: You don’t want to be judged] No, don’t really not care what other people think about me. I will feel like I’m quite an open, honest person, so if I feel like I’ve got something on my mind or I wanna say something, if you’re my mate and I feel comfortable around you, I can do so, I can be myself. But, some things people don’t need to know about you, because of like little things they might tell people or they might look at you in a different way, but in your head you know that that’s right, what you needed to do kind of thing. So if you know that it’s right and you feel that it’s right, then why should you even care what other people think? You shouldn’t.

Interviewer: So if you don’t want to share something with other people, as you said [Interviewee: Yeah] some things you don’t want to share with other people because they may judge you and so on. [Interviewee: so on, yeah] And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Sad really, because I don’t feel like people should judge other people, because they don’t know what they’ve been through and what’s happened to them in their little journey of life… but yeah.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Can we talk about what you’ve put next please?

Interviewee: So, the bed one, I feel like when you’re lonely and you’re sad and depressed, the best place is like, sometimes the best place for you to be is in bed, alone from people. That is like literally loneliness, I feel like. Like, no one bothers you, you’re just there with yourself and your feelings, kind of thing. No one can really bother you. I feel like, if I feel quite lonely as well, I sleep a lot. Maybe because I’m not up like doing things or like, I will literally just sleep. And sometimes you may actually need that sleep, because when you wake up, sometimes you do feel better. Like you can go to sleep pissed off and you’ll wake up and you’ll feel brand new kind of thing, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is that sleeping can make you feel less lonely.

Interviewee: Yeah, sometimes. But like, now that you actually read that back, now that you’ve said that back to me, it sounds quite bad. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well, me in my head, that’s what I would pick as loneliness. But you just said when you’re by yourself when you are lonely, that’s when you sleep more. But I feel like, some people, were me, I would be angry, I would have a nap, I would wake up and I’ll feel better. But other people, they might actually just want to sit there and sleep all day, and that is gonna make them feel ten times more depressed than they actually are. Because if you’re just laying in bed all day doing nothing, you’re gonna feel like shit. Do you know what I mean? Where if you actually get up and do things, I feel like me, if I’m feeling lonely, I can lay in bed, because I know I’m not gonna be laying in bed for four days. I know that I’m actually gonna get up and go do things when I feel better. Do you know what I mean? But yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is, you find sleep… you know short term sleep-

Interviewee: Sometimes it can be good for you, yeah. But not long term. ‘Cause I feel like if you’re just laying there all day sleeping, sleeping sleeping sleeping sleeping, waking up, eating, having a bath, going back to sleep, what are you doing with your life? That is gonna make you ten times more lonelier. Where if you just come, have an hour or two nap, wake up, feel better, do you know what I mean, go do something, then you’re gonna feel better, for like, maybe you’ve slept off you’re… I feel like you don’t really sleep it off though, ‘cause no matter what you’re still gonna wake up with the same problem that you went to asleep with. You might just feel better about approaching the situation, or how you go about it, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Tell me more about that, when you say that you might feel better approaching it.

Interviewee: Well, say if you’ve just had an argument, like, with your family, and you’re really sad about it, if you retaliate to the situation while you’re still angry and while you’re still sad, it’s just not gonna really be good, because your emotions are all over the place. Where if you go, you’ll have a nap, you’ll wake up, sometimes you might even wake up and think oh that weren’t even really that bad, do you know what I mean, like that was blown out of proportion for nothing. Like, it weren’t even that… that bad, and then you’ll just go and, do you know what I mean? So sometimes I feel like… yeah, have your little nap, and wake up, maybe you’ll look different about the situation and how you approach it.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is, um… like before sleep for example, you’ve had an argument with a family or friend, you might have a whole different emotions going on, [Interviewee: yeah] and then when you just have a nap, it seems like you kind of-

Interviewee:  You’ll wake up, you won’t be angry no more. You’ll think different. And I feel like, I don’t know about other people but me, when I don’t, if I don’t have a good amount of sleep, so like, I’ll try go to bed early and I’ll try wake up early, when I notice that my sleeping pattern is ruined, say I wake up like, say if I go to bed really late and I have to wake up really early in the morning, I feel like that kind of puts me in a bad mood for the… for the day, ‘cause you wake up tired, feel like shit. You just, don’t want to talk to people, people are just not what you want to communicate with at the minute, do you know what I mean? Especially like, if you wake up and you feel fresh, and you’re ready for the day, do you know what I mean, you feel like you can do a lot of things, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is, if you find yourself sleeping less than usual [Interviewee: mm] you might, you feel

Interviewee: I get really moody and grumpy. I don’t know if other people do, but I feel like I do. Feel like, it just makes me feel like, yeah, I don’t feel right. I just feel like something so little could be so big, but it’s not them, it’s just me overreacting, where I’m in a bad mood and I’m tired.

Interviewer: Can you tell me about how that impacts your loneliness.

Interviewee: Sorry?

Interviewer: Tell me about how, um, how that might lead to your loneliness.

Interviewee: ‘Cause obviously if you’re… if you’re like… if you’re tired, so say like, if you didn’t sleep that much, and you’ve woke up, and you’re in a really shit mood, you literally just wanna go back and get in bed and be lonely for a little while and be by yourself, have a nap, then you’ll wake up feeling better.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you would like to say about that?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. I’m just gonna pause the recording…

Interviewee: Alright.

Part 2

Interviewer: -do the same thing as before [Interviewee: Alright.] Um… so, can we talk about what you’ve put in the first box please?

Interviewee: Yeah. Um… so, I feel like it’s not really a place where you are, if you’re feeling socially connected. I feel like, it’s who you’re with, that is a big part of it… ‘cause you could be somewhere with the wrong people and you don’t feel connected to them, where if you’re with the right people, no matter where you are, you’re gonna feel good if you know that you’re safe and you’ve got good people around you.

Interviewer: So when you say… when you’ve written family and friends, um, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so family is a like… some people don’t have family, but I feel like to me, family is a big part of my life. And good friends as well. They are… but some friends are a bit funny sometimes, so you’ve got to be careful who you choose as your friends. And then your… your close friends will become your family kind of thing. But yeah, if you’re like connected, if you connect with someone, then you’ve got that connection no matter where you are or who else you’re with. As long as know you’ve got one good person by your side that you can trust enough, or like, you’re alright, no matter what situation you’re in, kind of thing…Yeah.

Interviewer: When you said one- like when you said a friend that you can trust, [interviewee: yeah] um, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, just someone that you can talk to about things, no matter what’s going on. Even if you’ve got family problems, you can go to your friends and talk to your friends about it… some friends. But yeah, it’s good to have good friends, to know that you’ve grown up with, that you’ve bonded with, you’ve shared moments with. ‘Cause if you’re antisocial and you ain’t had none of that, then you ain’t got no good memories to hold on to, kind of thing.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel? You know, having a friend that you can trust?

Interviewee: Yeah, good. I feel like everyone should have friends and try to connect with people, because you actually meet some good people out there. Like you might like think, oh I don’t like them, but when you actually get to know them, then they… they can be the loveliest person ever.

Interviewer: And when you said, um, some friends of yours can be funny [interviewee: yeah], can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so some friends ain’t really you friends, they just wanna be around you or use you for things kind of thing. But when you ain’t got nothing, and you’ve hit rock bottom, you’ll see where your good friends are and where your friends are that just wanted you for something. But yeah.

Interviewer: And how did that… how would that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um, yeah, sometimes quite sad, but sometimes it makes me feel good kind of thing. [Phone noise] I’ll put my phone on silent… So yeah, sometimes it’s like, you thought someone was actually your friend, but they’re not, and it’s like quite sad because you’re like oh, in your head you’re thinking we actually like had a good connection and you’ve been thinking we got on, but in their head their thinking completely different kind of thing, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: When you say completely different, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so in your head you’re thinking yeah, yous are friends, yous are getting on, things are going well, but in their head their like, oh yeah like… they don’t really like you, they’re just using you for things or they’re trying to be your friend because of you’re friends with someone else and they want to becomes friends with them. Just like little things, do you know what I mean? You realise who’s got your back and who ain’t and I feel like…

Interviewer: And when you say they’re using you for example…

Interviewee: Yeah, it could be like little things like… for who you hang around with, for what you like do kind of thing, for like who you are, or like little things like money or like going places or like lifts or like if you’re dropping them somewhere or something, just like any little thing, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: When you say like, they might want to hang out with you because of who you’re with [interviewee: yeah], tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Well if you’ve got a good connection with someone else, and some… someone new comes along, they only want to be your friend because of who you’re with. Do you know what I mean? Not because of you. They just want to be who you’re with, so they’ll use you to get close to other people. Do you know what I mean?

Interruption

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is some people come into your life-

Interviewee: For bad reasons, do you know what I mean? Some people are blessings and some people are lessons in disguise. Do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So when you said like some people come into your life because they want to like use you for the people that you are… for the people that you hang out with [interviewee: yeah], um… okay. So, tell me who that person might be, like, that you’re around [interviewee: anyone] that you want to… that they want to come to you for, to get to them.

Interviewee: Anyone. Some people like... if there’s like, I dunno like, a known person, or a person that gets on with everyone, and that person just wants to be with them because they’ll get a name for themselves and things like that, do you understand what I mean?

Interviewer: Tell me more about if they want to get names for themselves.

Interviewee: People… it’s their reputation kind of thing... Yeah, just who they are. That’s so like round here, everyone kind of knows everyone, do you know what I mean? So… some people will say good things about other people, some people will say bad things about other people. But… yeah, so it’s like if you’ve got a good reputation and people like you, then some people might just want to be around you for that, not because they actually like who you are kind of thing, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: So when you said not because of who you are, but because of your reputation [interviewee: yeah], tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Some people don’t want to be friends… like, some people don’t want to be your friend. Like, they’re acting like they’re your friend but really they’re not your friend. They just wanna… be round you, or like, do you know what I mean? Some people they’ll sit there, they’ll smile in your face, then they’ll leave you and they’ll chat shit about you behind your back kind of thing. Do you know what I mean? So you know that’s not a real connection, because that don’t happen if they’re really your friend. Do you… do you get what I’m saying? Where if… some… if if someone’s my good friend and I know that they’re my good friend, I would speak to them the same way that I would speak about them when they’re not there. That shouldn’t change. So I wouldn’t sit there and say oh yeah I really like you and then leave them and be like I fucking hate them. You shouldn’t do that, do you know what I mean? That… that’s not normal I don’t feel like.

Interviewer: And um… and when you have like friends for example that talk behind your back, and in front of you they say something but behind you they say something else [interviewee: mm], how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Sad, I suppose. It would make anyone feel sad. It’s not a nice thing.

Interruption

Interviewer: So um, you also mentioned that… well you said it makes you feel sad [interviewee: yeah] yeah, so tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well you’ll feel sad because… you’re thinking yeah, I really like them, you’ve got a good connection, you can trust them… then you’ll hear from other people no they don’t even like you, they’re just chatting shit about you kind of thing. They’re just bad mouthing you. That’s not really good.

Interviewer: Um… you also mentioned that some people might want to be friends with you because of the places you go to. [Interviewee: yeah.] Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well… if you’re going to like a party or you going out and… there’ll be a group of people that are going. Some people might not be invited but they’ll try and be friends with you just to be able to go to places kind of thing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Mm… I would say sad, but it’s just one of them things that happen in life, so… you can’t really be sad about everything that happens, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: When you say it’s one of those things that happens in life [interviewee: mm], tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well, things happen in life, even if you want them to happen or even if you don’t want them to happen. Like, maybe you can prevent it, but if it’s meant… if it’s like that was meant to happen in your life then I feel like that was meant to happen. So it’s literally just like one of them things that happen.

Interviewer: And how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… quite sad but you can’t really change it. But some things you feel like… you feel sad when you’re going through it, but once you’re through it, you’re happy because you’re like I needed to know that, I needed to learn that kind of thing. So it does actually make you a better person in the future But at them time when you’re going through it you might not feel strong like that kind of thing. Do you get what I mean? Yeah?

Interviewer: So when you say that it um… it, it’s a learning lesson for you [interviewee: yeah], tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well you’ve got to go through things in life to learn certain things, and do things to realise certain things. So it’s literally like you’re going through life and you’re growing through it at the same time. Do you get what I mean? Yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is… um, it might be good that you experience some form of hardship [interviewee: yeah] um… because something good’s gonna come out of it. As in you’re gonna grow [interviewee: yeah] and learn [interviewee: from situations, yeah]. And how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Yeah good, but at the time you might not feel good. But you’ll… it’ll… it’ll get better in the end I feel like.

Interviewer: Okay. Um, do you want to say more about that box?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay, can we talk about what you’ve put in the second box please.

Interviewee: Yeah. So… I feel like my lonely place is probably home. ‘Cause if I’m feeling lonely and I don’t want to be around anyone I can literally just isolate myself kind of thing. Not being around anyone, not talk to anyone, can just be by myself if I want to. So… if you’re like out with your mates and stuff and you’re not feeling right, or you’re feeling sad or low, then… if you don’t want to be around them then obviously go home, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: When you say you don’t want to be around people, you just want to be home [interviewee: yeah], tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well if you’re in a bad mood, you’re not gonna want to sit round everyone while everyone’s all happy. You’re gonna want to be by yourself… to think about what’s going on in your life. You’re not gonna want to sit round everyone while everyone’s happy and you’re gonna have to pretend or force yourself to act fine around them. But when you leave you know that you’re not fine, in your head, the whole time you’re sitting there thinking I’m not really fine. You’ve just got to be by yourself in certain situations.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Mm… sometimes quite sad, but sometimes I feel like you maybe need some time to yourself. You don’t always need to be around other people. You should get comfortable with who you are and being round… being in your own company, to make you realise that you don’t actually need anyone because you’re fine by yourself kind of thing. But… yeah, it isn’t so good to be around your friends, but when you’re feeling like you want to be around everyone and you’re feeling like you just want to be by yourself, then that… I feel like the best place to be is home. You don’t have to see anyone, walk past anyone, talk to anyone. You can just literally be by yourself and do what you have to do.

Interviewer: And how would you feel in that situation?

Interviewee: Alright, I feel like. ‘Cause if I know that I want to be by myself, then I know I’ll be alright when I want to be by myself. I know that if I want to be with one of my friends, I could call one of my friends. But I know that if I want to be by myself, then I’ll be by myself. I’ll leave my friends and the company that I was in.

Interviewer: So it sound like what you’re saying is home is a place where… where um you… you basically feel lonely the most.

Interviewee: Yeah. Unless you’ve got people around your house. But if there’s no on round your house, then yeah, home.

Interviewer: Because you just want to shut down and-

Interviewee: -and be by yourself. Yeah. In your own comfort zone.

Interviewer: Um… you also mentioned when you’re at home, for example, when you can’t go out, you might watch telly or go on your phone. [Interviewee: mm… yeah] Tell me about that.

Interviewee: Well, if I don’t want to be around anyone, I wanna be by myself, I’ll sit in doors and I’ll literally just watch telly or be on my phone un… until I feel like I wanted to be around people or whatever I wanted to do next, I’ll go in and do. But if I didn’t want to do anything, then I’ll sit in bed and go on my phone, watch telly, until it’s night time. And then I’ll probably fall asleep.

Interviewer: And how would it make you feel in that moment that you want to be alone and you go on your phone and you watch telly?

Interviewee: Sometimes I feel like it’s good to be alone. So you can just be by yourself and think about things or just chill out. I feel like sometimes it’s good to be by yourself. But I feel like you shouldn’t be by yourself all the time. You should go out and socialise with people.

Interviewer: I guess um… um I’m… I’m wondering, um, when you’re at… when you’re home, and you’re feeling lonely, you don’t want to be around people [interviewee: yeah] um, you said you might go on your… you might go on your phone and use social media, um [interviewee: yeah] um, or you might watch telly for example. How would it make you feel, when you feel alone, and when you’re on your social media for example, seeing your friends?

Interviewee: Yeah, sometimes it does make you feel like… a bit sad. ‘Cause you’re… you think why can’t my life be easy like there’s or they look so happy all the time or things like that, do you know what I mean? So sometimes it is a bit like hmm but… yeah. Like on social media you can also like watch things, do you know what I mean? Have you like seen like little like there’s things that you can watch, it’s not just literally your mate’s photos or what your mate posts. You can watch other people that you don’t know that… do you know what I mean? And like some people will put like inspiring things on there, so it might make you feel better about yourself, do you know what I mean? Or funny things, so it will make you laugh which will make you feel better, do you know what I mean?

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you very much. I’m gonna cancel the recording.
