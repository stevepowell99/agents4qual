Okay, thank you. So, can we talk about what you've put in box one, please?

So, the beach it's, in Hackney Wick it's um, it's about a 34-minute walk away and it's just by the canal, so, obviously, Hackney Wick is by the canal, but you just cross over this bridge here and you're right at the canal, there's loads and loads of boats and then there's just this, it has like these like quite like touristy people, who don't, who aren't really from the area, like these two boats, one that like has ice creams and I'm sure probably drinks and stuff and then one is, um one's like a bar, they're like boat bars, so they're like trendy things, but then just past that, so there's loads of people in that area, anyway, just sitting on the bank and then just passed that is like where the local people kind of sit and people call it the beach, I only found out recently, um and just like, I love that spot because when it's sunny, straight away when I wake up and the sun is shining through there, I just like, instantly, I need to get out the house, because I'm not wasting a British sunny day, that's just not happening and if I have no one to see or anything, you just go down to the bank and sometimes down to the beach and sometimes I go alone, sometimes I go with flatmates, but like whenever you go there you meet people, or you see someone you know, but like a lot of the time, like I've met so many people there, you know, you just sit and then you just talk to people next to you for like, yeah, it's just like, it's just nice and the last time I went, there were just these two, I just asked a guy for a lighter next to me and then I sat with them and we like chilled and I looked after their stuff when they went to go find food and things and it's just, it's just like, I just love that, just like, even if I don't get their contact details or anything like afterwards, I just love like just having that interaction, having the option of like actually speaking to someone next to you, because there is someone sitting next to you, or because, obviously, I work, I work in the area too and Hackney Wick is like an interesting place, because it's one of the few places in London that's like actually very community-based, because if you live and work here, you know everyone, like I barely know, I barely know anyone like compared to like how my flatmate Farah knows everyone, she knows everyone, but I think there's like a really big French Community here as well, so she met a lot of French Community, but um, but yeah, it's just lovely to sit there in the sun and people just, and also it's, it's my route to work as well, so, you walk along the canal, there's loads of people commuting, just walking along, there's just like so many people just walking and then there's um, so you can just, I just love people watching, I just love to watch everyone pass by and then recently I've got really into, I've spoken to a few people about this and it's a bit sort of creepy, but I've got really into like watching young family, so like and this is something, I don't think I could live anywhere now where couples aren't having children, because it just, it makes me feel so alive, like I watched this one couple, like when it was sunny bank holiday weekend, like a few months ago, whenever it was, and the guy was like in this gray t-shirt and like green board shorts and the lady was in like these navy blue, like very straight trousers, looking very 70s, orange and yellow striped shirt and they have like a newborn baby and she's just sat with the baby kind of how I'm sitting and he was sat behind her. They were just cradling the baby and then you know, they were having a lovely time with the baby, then she starts breastfeeding and then their friends come and they were all drinking like Bloody Mary's and stuff, but it was just like so wholesome and I really think that like living in an area where there's new life is so like rewarding for me, and in some kind of way like it just makes me feel like, it just makes me feel so happy, I can't even describe it, just like watching young like really wholesome families with children, and I've noticed a lot of that like when I get on the overground and stuff. So, people with babies that's something that's really lacking where my mother lives, it's all old people, so, there's no, no kids and just having like young kids around, it's like, I feed off that energy so much, so yeah, I love the, the beach for that reason, just like watching everyone go about their day it's just so like, just so lovely.

That's good, thank you. What is it about, and tell me more about young, like young people, young children.

I mean for me like it's not so much children, there's like an age where like boys grow up and all they care about is like guns and stuff, but it's before that, when they're like really young babies and toddlers, just makes me feel so happy, just that people are raising new life, like I mean, as scary as it is like raising a child and what the world is like becoming now, and how awful that's going to be for them, like I'm fully aware of that, but at the same time just like, I don't know, just like something about people, just starting a life, with like something that they have birthed themselves, is just insane to me, just like because I'm a very maternal person, like ever since I can remember all I wanted is a baby, so yeah, I think that really, really, I mean it's probably more because I'm a maternal person, more than anything, just like it, just yeah, just makes me feel like *pause* the Earth is like generating this like new energy and this is what it's going to become, but then I obviously, like I just said, I think about the really sad parts about how the world is deteriorating, so it's really awful for the kids, but I don't know, it's kind of nice for them to be around, even though their life is probably going to be terrible, but yeah, I don't know, just like it's, it's the purest kind of energy as well, like totally untainted by *pause*, by the whole kind of sinister life we all live now, like it's just like pure, I don't know, and it's just so calming, like babies are just so calming when they're not crying and all that stuff, they're just like, it's just tranquil, which yeah radiates onto everyone else I think, just like 'aah, calming little baby to sleep', like everything's good, no one has to worry about anything, but yeah, it just makes um, the area just like feels so much more lively compared to old people, just all sitting around like at the old people's club, like, like that's like dying life, I know that sounds like really, really horrible, but that is like, I mean, that's, that's the end of your life, like I'm glad they're having a great time at that old people's home, like live it up but, but it's more like new couples, young couples, because also I've noticed that, as well, is the couples in London that I've noticed like East London, on the overground and stuff, seem a lot younger than um the couple's I see back home that have kids, they all seem a lot older, so I don't really know what that's about, like why people here seem seem to be younger, but that just makes it, just makes me feel amazing because I wouldn't want to be a parent when I'm too old, like I'd like to be a parent on my like early thirties ideally, probably, um, yeah, I, and maybe this is actually stemming from what I was saying about my, my mom as well, because like I say my mom is like a different mother than what my brother and sister had, so maybe I think it's probably stemming from that, actually, because my mom is in her 50s now, so she's a lot older than she was like when well, how old is my brother? 28, so, I mean, yeah, say my mom's probably like, in her like 40s, when, 30s or 40s like when she was like fully raising my brother, actually, I think she was, she had my brother when she was like 26 or something, I can't remember but um, but yeah, I feel like I have watched my mum age like massively and because I say her life has changed so drastically in the last five years, it probably seems like she's a lot older to me than she actually is, but um, yeah, I would just, I just feel like it's almost unfair on a child to raise them when you're older, like my mom has, because I was an accident, I wasn't planned, so that's like a big, that's why I'm so, a lot younger than my brother and sister is, because they were planned and I wasn't, like a long time after. But, yeah, I just feel like it's almost unfair on a child to raise them when you're at an age where you're not like, or not even, not even it's an age thing, it's probably not even an age thing, it's like a mental age thing, because my boyfriend's mom is, you know, the same age as my mom, but she is like a vibrant young woman, kind of thing, and I just think you need to raise kids when you're still in touch with everything else that's happening, in like, in your local surroundings, in the bigger picture, like all, all these other things, I think you really have to be connected to, to just the world around you, if you're bringing, bringing up a child, like as opposed to just kind of be like in your own element, because you will really like... denying your child access of all these other like vibrant things that they could be a part of, which I guess is how I feel, but so yeah, I would like to be younger when I have a child, so I'm not, so I'm, I'm still active and I still want to do all these things with them, so I guess that's why I really like seeing like all the young couples, like actually being active with their kids, like just chilling, like where like everyone else is chilling, you know what I mean? Just like there are so many different people on that beach, that there's such a variety, there's like, there's parents with a lot of young kids, chilling with their friends, like who've taken their baby out, which I can imagine is quite a struggle like taking all the nappies and all that stuff that you need to take out when you have a child that young, so you have all, all of that, just to go sit on this beach and then you have like an older guy who's just been on his bike and decides to stop and just sit in the sun, there's me, who's just like by myself, reading a book, there's like a whole group of people like, I just like the diversity of that, of that beach and I like the fact that people call it a beach, because it's definitely not a beach, but people just call it that because like everyone around here knows it, that's just what they call it, but it just sounds very silly, but yeah, I think yeah, I just like the diversity of like all the people, they're just kind of like, might even just be walking home from work, they just sit and stopped just to enjoy the sun and that one bit, like everyone there is, is put there for the same reason, just like sitting in the sun, like a drawing, that's it, like that's it, it's just like pure enjoyment of what the sun is giving me... yeah.

Tell me about the diversity you mentioned.

Just like, I think the people, it's funny because like, basically, everyone in my house is lesbian and I am bisexual, so, but I didn't know many, many other lesbians other than the people in my household, because like I said, like when I was younger, I was denied that because everyone was very homophobic, so I couldn't even express myself and that, that sort of like, but um, but yeah, no, so we were on the beach and like it was me one of my flat, and two flatmates that are, two of my flatmates that are lesbians; one's in a relationship with another girl in the flat and then one's like single, anyway, and we just like look to the side and there's just like this whole group of, like a massive group of girls and my flatmate is just like 'oh, they're definitely lesbians', they come up to us and they're like flirting with us and then like, and all this stuff, and then we would just start talking and then you know, we go to their house a few weeks later for a party, so I mean, just like, like, there's like even like niche groups, because I fe-, yeah, I mean like I say, I don't really know that many other lesbians, so it's just kind of like, for me it's really nice to kind of open that box a little bit in such, like a, is more indirect because I guess in the past I've been like on Tinder and things like that, but it's really nice to just like do it really organically, just like meet someone on the green like, and that's it, you know, it's so much more organic than doing all the online... stuff, you just sit next to some people and they're nice and you'll chill and it's so cool, like everyone just has such a great and like there's no bad blood... ever, just everyone's just having the best time *chuckles*, everyone's super chill like, yeah, um, so I guess there's like, I mean, I guess I was talking about diversity in a sexual kind of sense, but um, but yeah even that it's just like nice, because like I hadn't been introduced to many people of that sort of like lesbian community and now I know that there's a huge lesbian community in Hackney Wick and that's good to be a part of, um... and then just yeah, I mean just like, there's just random anyone, like I've met so many people living here, people who I would never even think about, like not never even think about, but like would never cross paths with, um, I guess until, like we wouldn't be kissing, you know, like I say I'm younger like I wouldn't meet like some 40 year old raver guy, who does whatever he does every weekend, like that just wouldn't be in my social group, if I like stayed with all my 20-year-old friends and chilled with them the whole time, but I guess there's like a lot of diversity in the people that I meet and like their interest, I mean, the common interest of people who live in Hackney Wick is partying, because this is known as like a party area,  but um yeah, that beach is like, it's like all the party people, but everyone is just chilling. Everyone's just having a good day in the sun and yeah, I just, I just met a lot of people just like on that beach and then like I meet my flatmates' friends, we all hang out there, just a lot of different people, I'd never come into contact with unless you know, you're sat there... yeah.

Thank you. You mentioned that it's not like the online environment. Can you tell me more about the online my environment?

Just like, I mean, I was talking about Tinder because like I said, I've never really known any lesbians and when I grew up, even when I was at college, when I was 18, like anyone who was a lesbian was not saying they're a lesbian, they're not doing that for another couple of years, until they found their right people, kind of like what, what I've done like, I'm, I still struggle to speak about like bisexuality with people, because I am still very much affected of what I went through at college, like of people just like totally ripping me and my friend like, actually my friend (min 16:12) apart thinking we're in some sort of relationship when, when we weren't, but like it was just like... ruined our lives completely at college, so I still really struggle talking about that, so, I guess, and because I just don't really know many lesbians and don't really want to talk about it that much, so I'd go online, like on Tinder and stuff to find yeah, someone to sleep with or whatever um, and yeah, it's just so painful, like I've been on Tinder with girls and guys and it's just so painful like, just I had to delete it after a while when I first got it, because all you're doing on that app is forming relationships with people that you've never met, and like expecting a reply from someone that you've never met, like it's just insane, and I hate the whole like small talk of 'hey, how are you?', like 'what do you do', and having to explain what you do every single time, when I struggle to explain what I do like, it's just so much nicer to meet someone organically, like, and also, you know, that's something I'm totally denied of, if I were to live at my mom's, like I can't meet people organically, I can't, it's just, it's just like, there's no way of me being, being, being able to access anyone, who I feel like I can relate to, in any sense,  and um, yeah, so I guess I turned to boyfriends all the time or dating apps, all these things and all it was, the whole time, was just a way of me to like distract my mind of how little I have with, with other people, like my interactions with other people, how little those interactions are, I was trying to fulfil myself with talking to people online, you know, which is never going to work, you've never met them and you don't have any actual care for them, they're just a picture, then a message, that's it, it's just like, you have a relationship with a picture and a message, that's it, there's n-, nothing about it and I came to the point, like I said, of like expecting a text back or waiting for them to, you know, say something like flirty, or something stupid like that, and it's just like 'wow, I've never met this person', like this is so sad, like how his life even came to the point where like, where you just can't even talk to people, but I guess, you know, it must help so many people actually, all the Tinder and stuff, for people who are still, you know, living at home and like, like I was at my mom's, like that's actually helped a lot of people to actually get those interactio-, interactions, but it's not healthy, it's not like a healthy way of interacting with people, it's just, um, yeah loneliness in an app really, but then actually, you know, I said my two flatmates that are in a relationship, they met on, on 'Her', I think, I think 'Her' is a lesbian dating app, so I guess some people do find like love on it, but I don't think a lot of people are looking for love, they're looking for just meaningless interactions, sexual interactions.

How does that make you feel?

Well, I hate, I hate, I hate... so I went on one date with someone from Tinder and it, I hated going on a date with someone because what happened, what happens is, on these apps, is nothing can happen organically, because you're on an app and the second you send a message, it means 'I'm interested in you romantically, I've seen your pictures, I'm interested in you romantically', so from the second you start that date, there's no friendship, friendship doesn't exist in that date, like possibly you could get it afterwards, but it's like, say if you met like a nice person, wherever you are, and then you're like, 'oh', you get their like details and like 'oh, should we go for a drink on this night' and they're like 'yeah, sure', you can start a friendship from that, but when you, when you start on a dating app, that's all you are, you're romantically and sexually involved like from the get-go, you know, so it's just like, there's no room to take it slow, there's no room to like fully get to know that person for who they are, as opposed to something, as opposed to like a sexual object, because that's what they are from the second you send that message, it's literally, all it is is attraction, you know, it's just, it's really sad, like I really just dislike that thought of 'you can't be friends because you've met on like a dating app', like it just doesn't... and obviously that's not like a law, but it is just, it, that's how I felt on that date, it was just like, we're this now, like we're on a date, this is a date, this isn't just like us meeting up, getting a drink, seeing how it goes, like this is a date and we're probably going to sleep together later, like that's what it is, it's just like, it's pretty not nice and that also just makes you feel so objectified, like you're literally just a person to sleep with, in one of those apps I feel, I just struggle to see it any other way, yeah, it's um, it's quite brutal and it's just, I don't know, I just don't get it, like the same, like when someone, like you match with someone, it's like endorphin rush, kind of things, you know, you just feel good over nothing, like it means nothing, you haven't even met that person, it's not like when you meet someone and you're like 'oh, wow, I feel an attraction to this person, I feel, I feel this way and I feel that way and they're really nice or whatever', it's literally just like 'uh, we matched cool, let's see if we can hook up', like it's just like, it's really disgusting to me *pause*. But yeah, I mean, maybe that I'm, like for me sexually it's like if I am to sleep with someone I fully want to be involved with them and then I want, I want to love that person, but then, you know, I have flatmates who can sleep with someone and it can be nothing so, this is a very personal thing, this is like a, this is how I feel, I know like some people like get such great time out of it, but for me, I just like, I just really struggle with like sleeping with someone and not having a real emotional connection with them, like it seems, whenever I've done that, it feels like someone's taken something from me, like fully just like ripped something out of me *pause*, yes, is this okay?

Yeah, of course, no, I’m just in silence, in case you wanted to say more.

Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but yeah, I think I'm kind of done on that topic… of tinder.

Thank you. I was just going to ask you about, oh thank you, um, I was just going to ask you about, because you mentioned previously that, um, when you see your friends back in the countryside, like posting pictures on social media, like Instagram, being out in the pub and having fun and they didn't invite you and stuff, um can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, um, well, at that time I was feeling very vulnerable, because I was going through a breakup and all those silly things, um but also I was going through a lot of other things, like I lost like a drastic amount of weight, because I was taking this medication that like really messes with your appetite, so I was, I was really thin, I was really in a bad, bad way, and I, when they weren't inviting me to these things, in hindsight is, I know it's because and they even told me it's because they knew I couldn't get there, but I took it so personally, because I was like 'wow, these people are really supposed to be like my really good friends, they're supposed to be there for me, but they can't even ask me out for a drink when I'm like in a really bad place', so seeing it online of like, of that, just made me feel really unwanted, like really unwanted, maybe question if I was like too much for them, like all the things I was going through, like how much you can actually rely on someone else to take care of you emotionally, like that's pretty much all on you, um no one, no one actually like really truly cares about, about how you're doing, I mean, there are the odd people who do, but like from what I've experienced so far, like I haven't really come across anyone who like is totally committed to, to caring for someone else, but you know what? Neither am I, like I'm not committed to taking care for anyone else and you probably can't because you've got to take care of yourself first, but yeah, no, it was like this, the on Instagram thing, but the thing is, is, I've, I've like really had to put it in my mind recently that what you see on Instagram is so distant from, from reality, like I've always known that, but like it's really like really hit me recently, like I said to you about my boyfriend's mom, how her being this power woman, she is such a power woman, but she, she's very active on Instagram constantly. constantly, constantly, story after story after story, post after post after post, and I think through her I've kind of come to realize actually what we see on Instagram just isn't the reality, because like all her captions are just like super positive and she's a very positive woman, but it's like really intense, but I'm just like you actually don't, like you live this lifestyle, she's, you know, a yoga and Tantra teacher, so she's very like connected, she lives that lifestyle, but it's also just kind of like, I feel, I can't even put it into words. I feel like it's, it's almost a *sighs* it's um, ugh what's the word? I use it all the time, you're overcompensating for what you feel like you're lacking in certain areas and you need to come across to other people online about like who you are,  you know, I've noticed a lot of overcompensation, as well, like through Instagram, through real life, like again in the art world, where you have all these kids who like dress in such, such a way every single day and I used to dress in such a way every single day, you know, like big high-heeled boots on every day, like handbag, whatever, you know, fur coats, I was that like arty kid in college, but it's all, it really is, like looking back, like it's overcompensation, like when you feel like you can dress like how you want to dress or come across like how you want to cross on, how you want to come across on social media, like I feel like that's when you like really establish a true... like you kind of know who you are a bit more, rather than like trying to tell people who you are through all your posts, through your clothing, through all this other stuff that you're trying to like overcompensate for, because you're lacking in it, in like your Creative Studies or in your social life or whatever, like if you're constantly, I don't know, it just seems, it seems kind of like, I don't know, just like every time you're with someone, if you feel the need to post a picture with them like, so you're just trying to show everyone that you're with someone, like, like have fun in that room with that person, don't try and make it look like you're with all these people constantly, because you're going to make other people feel like they need to be living that lifestyle and really they don't, like each to their own.

How does that make you feel?

I mean, it's fine, like I think in the past it's made me feel quite lonely, but now, like I said like I come to terms with it and I just realized that like everyone, like everyone, social media is there for everyone, everyone has the right to use it in the way that they choose, choose to, but um for me, I used to post all the time on Instagram, all the time, all the time, like three times a day or something and it was stuff that I was interested in and I felt was genuine to me but, you know what? I deleted it all, now I post every like month. maybe, or something like that, maybe a bit more and I post not for any reason, like at all, sometimes I post my artwork, but I haven't done in a long time, but now I just post just because I feel like it, like there's no like real reason behind it. I'm not posting to try and show that I'm with this person or show that I'm doing this or whatever, I'm just posting because I just, I just think the picture is funny or something, like there's like no reason for what I post now, like I'm not trying to get anything across I don't feel, um, but I think yeah, I mean, I think that's great when people can do that, because people, I mean now, especially for my age group, you meet someone's Instagram page before you meet them, so you already have an idea of who they are, before you've ever even met them, so it's only natural for people to want to present themselves on social media in, in like the best light but *sighs* but I just, I'd rather be a bit more low-key about it, I'd rather someone like prefer my personality, rather than my Instagram's personality, yeah. I mean, I guess that's always been the way, it's not just Instagram, like when Facebook was a big thing, it was the same with Facebook, it's kind of like the amount of likes and stuff you get is how popular you are and all that bullshit, that actually really means nothing, but I guess when you're a kid, it feels like it means everything in the whole game of popularity, when you are a child, but yeah, it's just like, yeah posting pictures, especially when, when I was younger like, on Facebook, actually like posting, girls posting pictures of like what party they were out, who they're with or blah blah blah, it's all to just like prove that you're so popular and you're so this and you're so that, but like really, when you can just, when you don't feel the need to do any of that, that's like the best kind of confidence and beauty, just like not caring about how people like view your profile, it's so stupid.

Thank you, um okay, is there anything else you want to say about that? Can we talk about that, the box...

I feel like we've talked about this quite a lot, my mother's house, um maybe I should, should I think of something else, maybe?

No, no, you know what? If you, if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine like *gets interrupted*

I just feel like the one we did before, it was kind of like, I spoke so much about my mother's house, you know, already, I feel like I've kind of said everything I feel like saying about that.

Yeah, sure, okay, so that's it for this one, um, so, um, do you want to move on to the next section, the final one, which is, which is a questionnaire?
