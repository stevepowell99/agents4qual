So, I guess the image, oh sorry...

No, no, don't worry, don't worry. Hmm, thank you, so, um, actually, can we start by talking about what you've put first?

Yes, okay, yeah. So, the first image I've put in is that one there with kind of a big circle and lots going on and I guess that one's kind of a comment on how like you can always feel so small in a world where there's so much going on all the time and you feel like you're not, you know, I've just kind of done like a plane circle, like a really small plane circle compared to all the other fun squiggly lines that are going on, um, it's kind of just how you can have, sometimes you don't feel like you live up to the part of everything else that's going on around you, um, and I guess yeah, that can be, it can be very intimidating and everything else, um, I guess it's that one.

Thank you, when you said living up to the... standard, did you say?

Yeah.

Can you tell me more about that?

I mean, I think maybe, maybe it's specifically in London, but it kind of there's always so much going on, you kind of see all these people doing all these really cool, exciting things and they seem to be doing a lot and then you, it makes you kind of feel a bit, I used to say 'oh, why haven't I done all this with my life when everyone else has done all this?', kind of thing, um, I guess, yeah.

So, like seeing someone or some people doing things that you may not be able to do, um...

Yeah, yeah, I guess them doing it and putting themselves out there, a lot of the time you feel a bit shy putting yourself out there, as well, and you are seeing a lot of people kind of out there confidently doing it, makes you feel a bit lonely and you kind of see a lot of people doing, maybe doing it together, I guess can be like a big, big thing, out, doing all these like really fun things and then you kind of just, I don't know, maybe a bit intimidated by it, but um, yeah.

So, you're saying that when you see, for example, your friends or other people doing things and then you, necessarily, are having all this fun, but you're not doing those things, it kind of makes you feel like, it make you feel intimidated.

Maybe, maybe not just on like the fun bit, more, I guess like more in terms of career-wise, I think there's like a lot of people going out and very successfully doing their career, kind of, good on them. Like a lot of, like a lot of people I know have just done, like done very well for themselves, but it kind of makes it a bit intimidating, kind of scares you off a bit from doing it yourself, I mean, actually, maybe not, like it half inspires you, but at the same time it's kind of, it's, yes, it's really intimidating, I guess, kind of seeing all these people doing so well and even if you can be trying for ages and that doesn't happen, I guess that's kind of what I was trying to capture in that image there.

And how does that make you feel?

I mean, at times, it can be quite daunting, um and I guess it makes you a bit nervous, nervous because I think, it's, the putting yourself out there and likely have the same success as those people did, when you put yourself out there and I guess yeah, I guess it does make you doubt yourself quite a bit, but, I mean, me, personally is, I think that's probably only small, small moments where I feel like that, I try and always look on the positive side of that, I guess, and always trying like 'Oh, why not? Let's try and do it a little bit', but it can be, a lot of the time you do get those moments of 'Oh, like' *laughs*, kind of thing, yeah.

When you said like, you see other people, where do you, can you tell me more about that?

Hmm... yeah, I guess kind of just online, I listen to a lot of radio stations, since like lots of people are going off and doing that, and social media and everything else, um I guess even yeah, I guess, I guess social media is probably like the main one, social media and I guess radio I think they're probably two big things where you see a lot of stuff going on or even just word of mouth, when you kind of hear about all these other people doing these, doing all these like amazing things in their career and um it's kind of yeah, I don't know, it's kind of quite just, if you haven't already got your foot in the door, I think it makes it, yeah, just quite overwhelming, but yeah, I guess social media is probably the main platform where that happens.

Can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, I mean like, I mean, I guess for me Instagram is probably the main one where you see kind of all that stuff happening, people constantly posting it as well, because it's not just your friends and even the accounts you don't follow, because you've got that section of Instagram, which is where you search people you don't even follow and then you just go down that rabbit hole searching these people and all the time you end up with people you don't even care about, but watching that and yeah, it can be quite, um, yeah, it is, you can waste a lot of time in it I think, doing it on the social media and like looking all that stuff, it's all, yeah, I don't think it's the best, but…

So when you, so tell me about when you see like your friends on social media or even other people in general, you said that they may, does that make you, I'm just wondering like, did you say that makes me feel lonely?

It, it does, it's in the sense that kind of maybe is, maybe I wasn't referring to lonely on a personal level, but more of like, a, it's hard, it's hard to explain, as in, they are, I guess, I'm kind of a non, *pause*. No, I'd say, okay, yeah, on, on a personal level like seeing them doing all these kind of things, I guess, it does make, make you a bit lonely in the sense that I mean, they always make it out that they have this amazing like support network and everything else and, you know, kind of that they're always like out with friends and doing all this kind of stuff and I guess, it can make you a bit lonely because you're like 'oh, I don't, I'm not able to be going out and doing all these things with all these people' and it's kind of like 'Oh, who I have, who do I have that I could rely on for this certain thing?' Like, I mean like, for me like I've got friends but sometimes there will be a specific thing that I want to do and it's very much like, I sometimes I feel like I'm not able to do something because these people like, like that person because they have had a good support network and then it's kind of just 'who do I have that can help me out with that?' and it's very, it gives you a sense of loneliness and that you can't, you don't have anyone to, to connect with on that... level, I think of certain, for certain things, but. That answers that question *laughs*.

So, you might, for example, think of yourself 'Oh, like' or you might just consider or contemplate who do you, who can you do the things that you see other people doing it on social media?

Yeah, I think it's yeah, who could I, who could I do that with and sometimes, sometimes it's like 'oh, I don't have anyone I can do that with', then you feel a bit kind of, I don't know, left, left out I guess, especially, especially if it's like, the worst is probably friends of friends who you don't really know and you're kind of like 'oh, we would probably be really good friends because I can see you do all this stuff', and be like 'I'm also really interested in', but then it's, I'm not a very outwardly spoken person on social media, so I'd never go and randomly message someone being like 'Hey, saw you were going to this like', do that, um, but yeah.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say?

Hmm... about that one... no, I guess not, no.

Okay, thank you. So, can we talk about what you've put in the second box, please?

Yeah, I guess, that one is just how I was kind of showing how you can feel like there's this physical barrier between you and everything else in the world and it's just something, sometimes you just... how can I connect with other people and sometimes I can just feel incredibly hopeless, um and I guess yeah, how just sometimes it can just seem like it's, I mean, something in plan view, but like picturing like a big wall, hum and sometimes it is just hard and like, I guess, building up the emotional... emotional kind of readiness to try and, try and like get past that wall to put yourself out there, that can be quite, quite daunting, um, I guess, yeah, just that physical feeling of not being able to connect with anyone, um at all, can be quiet, yeah, I guess creates that experience of loneliness.

Hmm, so, tell me, because you, so, okay, so you mentioned that, um, you basically, it might, this picture's portraying that sometimes it's difficult to connect with people, that there's a barrier in, to conn-, that there's a...

Yeah, there's just, there's just that physical, um, feeling of being kind of separated from everyone else, I think, to some extent, whether it's, I don't know, because you stay inside or whatever else, just that like, I don't know, I'm just thinking of like times when I have felt lonely, it does sometimes feel like that, I guess, um even though I mean it is kind of all imaginary, but just like, that's like the physical feeling that there is that kind of wall between you and everything else and there's all that stuff happening on the other side of the wall, but you can't seem to get to it, so.

Tell me more about the wall.

Um... I guess it's kind of a subconscious feeling, I'd say, it's kind of, I don't know, whether you don't feel you have the social um ability to kind of put yourself in situations or anything like that, or just, it's just, I don't know, sometimes you can... stop yourself, I think, as well, because I mean, obviously, it's not a real wall, it's a mental wall, but I think sometimes in your mind you build up this wall so much that you stop connecting to other people, I think, in a big way, I don't know if like me personally like I've always struggled getting to like a certain level of like friendship and understanding with people, I've always kind of, I mean, I guess, when you go into the more kind of metaphysical topic of the wall, like building up those like physical walls, um, between like people you meet and you know, there's sometimes people like, you know, like they think you're really good friends and they might tell you everything but it's kind of they never really realize there's so much more to that, but then it's something, because I can go back to like childhood and everything else but like having those walls up is a kind of safety, safety barrier as well, I guess, yeah, I guess that makes these walls kind of like that, it's kind of two different meanings of the wall there I guess *laughs* but yeah.

Tell me about the safety barrier.

Hmm, safety barrier... I guess that because there is so much going on around you, it's kind of, you always feel safe and not exposing yourself I think, you do feel, yeah, there's a self-confidence that well, at least you're the only person who can let yourself down a little bit, um, so, just like not exposing yourself and like letting other people see your weakness a little bit, I think, I don't know for me it's something I've always resorted to and like, the one or two times, I kind of had had very like deep chats with some of my close friends, they were like 'wow, I've never seen you like this at all before' and then it's kind of something I think, I personally struggle with, um, but then every time I have done that and had really nice chats with some of my friends it's been really nice and relieving for me, but it is something, I don't know, it's just something, yeah, it's just, I guess a form of self-preservation in some ways and I don't like the idea of seeming weak to people, I think, I think I like to seem very strong and independent because I was, I mean, I've had to rely on myself a lot as a child and so like any time something comes like to undermine my independence, I get very defensive over it, so best to like not let that show it all to begin with, like, I can't handle things I guess, but yeah.

Tell me more about that.

Um... as in...

So, when you said that you don't want other people to see your weaknesses...

Yeah.

Can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, okay, I guess other people seeing my weaknesses, its kind of, just the feeling of being vulnerable is something I've never liked, yeah, and as I said, when I was younger, I always kind of had to, I was always looking after myself and my mum was quite, she was very much the strong, independent woman, but she was also never there, so I was kind of, I had this idea of what a woman should be kind of, in my mind, but then I was also a little bit left to fend for myself at the same time. So, I kind of was forced into that role, I didn't think there was anything wrong with it and then, other than that, and it was just like, my dad he wasn't a very open person, so I just was, I thought that was normal snd then anytime, I guess, since that kind of, growing up, anytime I felt like my independence was questioned, I just found myself getting really, really defensive um and I kind of, I guess, I kind of put it, I don't know, I'd, trying to think of the best way to say it, I just yeah, I'd get really defensive and it makes me not trust myself a little bit, if I like have shown my weaknesses, um if I, if I do expose my weaknesses... weakness is a very vague term, but like if I do kind of expose that side of me to some people, it's very much, then they can let me down and I think, it's just something about being able to rely on myself and then yeah, that should be it, yeah.

When you said that um, you, exposing yourself to others and your weaknesses, you're not doing that because you might worry, you might wonder, you might worry that others might let you down.

Yeah, they might let me down, like not, not used against me intentionally, but sometimes if they know about like a certain thing, it's the kind of, I don't know, it's, it's, it's, I think it's like a natural, I don't know if this, this could be right, but like I have in my mind that subconsciously that people will sometimes use your weaknesses against you, even if they might not even realize that they're doing it, it might just be that they want you to come to this thing, so they say something in a slight way that will make you, make you go to that even if you don't want to, and I don't think they're doing intentionally, I think it's just a subconscious thing, they're like 'oh, how can I convince this person to come with me?' And I don't know, maybe I'm not a very trusting person, but I feel, yeah, just like the only person you can kind of trust on is yourself, so then if you fail then you're, only you are to blame, it's kind of, I don't know, for me, I always feel like it's an easy thing to blame other people for like a certain failure and I don't want to ever be doing that, so that's why I don't let them because if I have exposed my weaknesses then I'll jump on the trying to like blame them kind of thing, I'll like 'oh, blablabla', like they use that against me and everything else, but I think yeah, I don't know, I like, I like it being on myself, I guess.

How does that make you feel?

I mean, I, I guess, I have always, I've never really minded it, I think, until probably like recently, if anything I would kind of felt empowered by it, a little bit, but then it's more been recently like developing close friendships and relationships with people like, I found it to be  a really big issue, um, in that kind of sense, like people often say that they really struggle getting close to me, um, I think, but, so, I've always felt like it was a good thing and I don't think it is a bad thing, obviously independence, but obviously, it's, I feel like I've just built up those walls too much now a lot of the time and it does make it really hard to kind of connect, connect with people, because they're always like 'Oh, I feel like you don't like me or all this other stuff, we never, we never do this, we never do that' and it's kind of, it's kind of hard, like I try to and it's something I'm learning to do slightly better, but I definitely think it has hindered on some friendships and relationships I've had, um, n the past couple of years, so, I guess in that sense yeah, it has made a big physical impact on my life, but I do also think it is a good thing to some extent, so it's kind of, need to find the balance *laughs*, but yeah.

Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Um... not that I can think of.

Before we move on to the next bit, I was just going to ask you, so what is it on the other side of the, the wall?

That was, that was just kind of everything else going on and it's, I kind of did them as like sharp, dashed not sharp, but like straight, harsh lines, as in you think what's behind the wall is like quite scary and everything else, but I mean, it's just, it's just because you can't really see what's on the other side of the wall, so it's you imagining what's on the other side of the wall and I guess it's just meant to be the whole big scary world that's out there.

Tell me more about that big scary world out there.

Hmm, I guess, it's the kind of out there where you could get hurt, whether it's physically, mentally, financially, there's lots of kind of ifs and buts and maybes and it's, it's quite easy to kind of stay safe with what you know and everything else. And yeah, I guess putting the trust into other people is a big thing, I guess, yeah, so I guess on the other side of the wall, it's meant to be just other people, other places, everything else, I mean, I personally like to try and get over that wall as much as possible and I like to think I do, I do put myself out there quite a bit, but there are definitely moments a lot of the time where it does feel like that and you kind of, you kind, I found every time you do imagine it, like a certain thing, the other side of the world always seems so kind of scary and horrible and this could be wrong, it's going to be so hard and everything else, but then, kind of, you know, once you do get to the other side and you've climbed over the wall, it ends up normally being fine in the end, but, but yeah, I guess that's that.

Okay, do you want to say anything else for that one?

Hmm... I don't think so, I can't think of anything at the moment.

You mentioned, you mentioned that there are financial things, you know, people, mental things and so on. Can you tell me a little more about that?

Yeah, I mean, I guess there, I was kind of talking about taking risks, innit? Um, as in case, I mean to get anywhere in life you have to take risks, I guess, and they're a big part of life, but I guess it's kind of, how those risks can seem scary, like kind of, I mean, I guess, for example, for like the financial thing, I'm finishing my job in six weeks time and I'm going to go work part-time in radio, so it's kind of, I've, at the moment, I've got this very big wow, like actually, maybe, I shouldn't be doing it, maybe I should just stick to what I know, like keep to myself and do architecture, rather than go out, like my current job is like quite easy and I get paid alright and everything else and like I love it, but, it's not what I wanna be doing right now, but then there's this whole thing with the radio, I'm going to get paid a lot less and so it's all kind of just very, it's yeah, there's a lot of risks and it's kind of, it’s kind of hard and like I can see that physical wall there and I'm going to push through that wall, but it's like, at the moment it's definitely there and I know it's going to be hard and I've got to organize all this stuff and I know that's going to be feeling, sometimes I get these feelings like 'Ooh, maybe I should say, stay safe on this side of the wall, yeah stick to what I know', but I mean, I know I will get up and get over that wall, but it's definitely, definitely still there, like 'oh, it's not too late to just go back home to Australia' *laughs* Yeah,

And then you mentioned people, can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, um I guess that could go for meeting, meeting new people can sometimes be quite scary and intimidating, I guess, it's, sometimes, I know, I found for me personally a lot of the time I've got my friends, who I'm quite comfortable with and sometimes the thought of spending an afternoon with someone you're not that comfortable with, it's just very much, it's just not what you want to do, even if, even if you think they might be a great person, it's just because you don't know them that well and it can get very, um not as in, like it will probably be fine hanging out with them, but sometimes you're like 'oh, I just want to be like weird with my close friends, who don't care if I'm being weird', but if I don't really know the person and I kind of have to put on this like certain face, um, I guess, and be a bit less weird, um and I guess that, that can be quite daunting as well, I guess, and make you not want to go out and do things, I think, a little bit um, just because the thought of those people, and then also, just the problem with the people you don't like as well and you know, I don't want to do this because that person will be there or I don't want to, yeah, do something because they'll see me be, still see me do it and everything else, so yeah, I guess that's the people side of that.

So, not being able to get comfortable around the people that you don't know...

Yeah, yeah, I think, I think, it makes a big difference, um, like I'm quite a sociable person, I don't have that many issues with people, but I guess just, it can, sometimes it's just really tiring and hard and you do just want to be able to completely like relax with the whole group of people, sometimes that can't happen, um, and it's just kind of, certain people maybe you feel like you should act a certain way in front of them, as well, which is just, is just, then you're not fully being yourself and you're not fully comfortable and you feel slightly on edge, because you're too worried about saying something that might be viewed as something else and all that kind of stuff. So it's just kind of, I don't know, I feel like that is definitely a barrier for me, when I'm deciding on doing things, kind of which people will be there, and they definitely are those people who would affect my choice on doing something, I guess, whether it's going out or starting a new job or anything like that.

Do you want to say more about that?

Hmm... I don't think so. Yeah, no I think I've said pretty much what I probably could say about that.

Hum?

I think yeah, I think, I think that's probably all.

Thank you, can we talk about what you've put in the third box, please?

Yes, so the third one, I guess was kind of talking about how trying to reach out to friends and sometimes not getting it back and how kind of, at the beginning you'll always keep trying, um, you know, like maybe you've met someone or someone you used to be good friends with, and you're like 'oh, let's try and connect with them; and basically it's just trying to connect to people, with people and like you can try, you try really hard at the beginning, I find, then if you're not getting much back, then you try less and less and less, and then eventually just becomes no contact at all, um and I guess it's kind of that attempting to connect with people and you just not getting anything back, which I think, definitely, can happen, um, or it's kind of like the same in both ways, you both try at the beginning and then you kind of, you both start to fade that out and that's just in, that's, that friendship, relationship, whatever kind of just gone because that signal I guess faded between, between you two, I guess, if it's over like a, it's kind of, it's kind of meant to be like a, I was thinking like Wi-Fi signal, kind of thing, like at the beginning it's like a lot stronger, the closer you are, it's a lot stronger, but like, as soon as you get farther away, it's like harder to connect to it as well, I guess, it's kind of what... I was going to that, but yeah, and eventually you stop trying as well because there's only so much effort you can put into something, if you're not going to get anything back, or if you're really getting a little bit back, so I guess that's that, I guess that, yeah, that big sense of loneliness you can get from that *pause* or if like, I was kind of thinking like a specific example, like if you wanted to go do something that day and then you just like try and getting, getting contact with all of these people and then they just can't do it and then you're kind of just left sitting there like 'oh, I haven't, haven't got anyone to hang out with today', I guess that's quite a bad feeling of loneliness as well. So, I guess kind of those two things, which I don't do that.

Thank you. So you mentioned a couple of things, so you mentioned that, um, the first one you said was that like, you come closer and closer with people but then eventually their relationship, if you don't put as much effort  from both sides, the relationship starts, sort of, you know, disappearing and disappearing and disappearing, and becoming weaker, essentially.

Yeah, yeah, I think that was just, kind of, yeah, at the beginning, at the beginning of any kind of relationship, I think, like I was in, with other partners or friends or whatever else, I think, the beginning, they're always, it's always fine and then it's just a matter of you both having to put that same amount of kind of energy and output into it for it to remain, otherwise, it doesn't, but then it's kind of, it's kind of a tricky one, because then there's some relationships or friendships that you have with people and it's the, kind of thing, there isn't that signal at all, as in there is no signal but you'll still see them kind of once every six months and when you see them once every six months it's still that fine like 'oh, we're still old friends', like that kind of thing, so it's kind of like the weird, odd ones you have, but I feel like, a lot of things, it's kind of, there's like disconnect, I think, forms, quite quickly, um yeah, I think it forms quite quickly and I think especially kind of, once you get older as you leave high school and everyone kind of goes off their separate ways, you know, when you're in high school you have your group of friends, you're like 'oh, we're all going to be best friends forever', kind of thing, and you have that in your mind and then you start to realize everyone goes to Uni, and at that point, there's a couple people in differently, different Unis and then like, once universities finish, everyone starts going off to different, different countries, different jobs, everything else and then they do kind of, I don't know, people just get busy with their own lives and they stop, kind of, I guess, sending that signal out, they might even try now and then but then yeah, it just, it just fades, it just fades, I guess and you know, sometimes, it's meant to happen, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes it's life that causes it, sometimes it's the person, I think like sometimes, you know, like me moving to the other side of the country, obviously I'm going to lose contact with some of my friends back home, but then, you know, then there's some people who maybe I thought I would have remained more in contact with and I haven't and I think that's on both ones as well, there were some people who I was really good friends with, I've barely spoken to since I've moved over here and I think that's... neither of us have put in the effort really, I've been wanting to put the effort in and they haven't gone back and then, I've been surprised by some people who have put the effort in, um and it's been a really, really nice surprise, I'm kind of like 'oh, I should be doing this more often to other people' *laughs* but yeah, I guess that, that's what that one was about.

So, just, yeah, losing in touch with your friends, basically not putting as much effort makes you lonely?

Mmm, yeah, yeah, it can feel, it can feel very much, like there have definitely been a couple of like, relationships and friendships, where you've constantly felt like the person who's putting in all that effort to go out and like, kind of, you're sending out all these messages and being like 'oh, by the way can we do this? Can we do that?' and it's always, you know, sometimes they get back to you, sometimes they don't, but it's very much, it can feel like a kind of futile effort, I guess, trying to do that and make all those connections all the time and it can be quite tiresome trying to do that, it's kind of, I think a lot of people they, I don't know, these days... feel, it's quite um, I don't know, I don't think a lot of people put in... the effort as much, um, I guess, maybe just because they have other things to do, other ways to connect and it's, I don't know, it's kind of a shame because I think it's, even just like looking at... some of my friends who have been like 'Oh, you two would be like really good friends together, because you guys have so much in common' and then like even those friendships like, they meet up once, but they never, people don't really seem to want to do stuff after they meet only once or twice or something like that, it's, you have to that, one of the people has to be like quite willing to put themselves out there for a friendship to work these days, I find, if neither of you are, then it's never going to work, but like there always has to be that one person. I feel like sometimes that's becoming less and less maybe, but that could also just be age and everything else, it's hard to tell.

Thank you, you mentioned the second option that you could portray, you mentioned that it was...

Yeah, that was more just like a specific example of like when you want to go out and do something and then it's kind of, you're trying to reach all of  your friends and none of them get back to you, whether it's just because they're busy or they're, I don't know, too tired or something, you know, if, it's just like a really small, trivial thing like 'oh, who wants to go? Does anyone want to go to the flower market today?' and you message three or four people and then you can't, you can't get anything, you don't get anything back from your friends or they just don't respond or they just can't do it and then you're kind of just stuck sitting there being like 'Oh, I really want to do this thing, but I don't know if I want to do it by myself'. So, then you kind of just like sit at home feeling a bit lonely or you go to it and feel really lonely there, or you go to it and meet all these people there and it's really nice, but that only happens like 50% of the time, um and I guess that's, that's more just like a, it's a very physical definition of the loneliness, I think that kind of yeah, when you want to do something and you can't find friends to do it and you're like 'ooh, I don't have any friends', but yeah.

How does that make you feel?

Um, I mean, I think, it depends... on kind of what I'm doing, like a good example, like if I was to try and find a friend to do something this weekend and I wasn't able to find anyone and I was asking last minute like, it's, I don't mind too much, I think, now, because I know all my friends work full time, everyone has a lot going on, it's not, it's not like a taking it personally, kind of thing, but when I look back to when I was on like Uni holidays or something like that, and I haven't really done anything for the past 3 or 4 days, and I know all of my friends hadn't been doing anything and they did that, then you did get that just kind of overwhelming sense of 'Oh, like the people I know don't want to hang out with me, is that what that is?' or, I don't know like 'can I really not find anyone to hang out with today?' like you, like 'it's a small town, I know a lot of people like how have I not been able to find anyone to hang out with' and then it's just kind of and especially I think, if you get the idea to do something fun in your head and then you can't because of other people it's quite, it is... very disappointing and you become very unmotivated, I think, like if, if I get to  that point I will just be like 'okay, let's just sit in bed and watch Netflix then', but yeah, like it's not the best feeling it can be, yeah, can be quite upsetting, but I mean these days as in, I find I can't get too upset about it, because I know I do it back to a lot of people all the time as well, people will be like 'Oh, do you want to come and do this?' and I'll make up some excuses, it's not because I don't want to see them, probably just because I can't be bothered going out, so I'm kind of like, I know I can't get to upset over it, but yeah, I guess, yeah, it's probably that.

Thank you, you mentioned Netflix...

Hmm.

Can you tell me more about that, please?

It's a very easy fall back and the interface of Netflix is very... it's very well done, I think, it constantly has the new changing title, so you get very easily sucked in, so, it's very easy to spend an entire day at home watching Netflix and I feel like that definitely stops me from doing a lot of things I probably want to do as well, just in terms of, it's not, I feel like it doesn't stimulate me in a way that makes me want to do more, as in like, for example, like I'm, I like to do art and drawing and that kind of stuff, but I won't find myself motivated to do any like that, anything like that after watching Netflix for the past four hours, but if I go, go out and go to an art gallery or something like that, I'll feel insanely motivated to draw and do everything else, um and so I think, it can, you know, if you start off the day watching Netflix, it makes you a lot less willing I think to try and go and connect with people, because you are, I guess, you could say going back to that whole little wall, you're like 'oh, there's a wall there, but I've got Netflix over here in my bed, which is comfortable and nice, like why would I go over go out and do that?' Whereas like I found like a big thing, if I haven't done anything kind of cultural, I'll put myself out there in a while and do something, I'll find like, the big thing is boredom, but like I think Netflix could take easily take away like a day or two of that boredom if that makes sense, as in for me to get to the point to be like ‘right, I'm going to make myself go out and do something’, it would be like, probably a day less, if I didn't have Netflix, if that makes sense, I'd probably do that a day earlier, let's say I had a week off, um probably about the third day, f I had just been kind of doing stuff around the house, I'd be like, right, now, I'm gonna do a big project, so go out and do this, so I might be like right, I'm gonna go hiking or get like, I'll get bored enough to do that, whereas if I had Netflix involved as well, I'd probably easily spend about two, three days just kind of watching Netflix and then, then it would be the two days of getting bored and then go and do it, but by that point it's the end of the week, so I don't have the opportunity to do it, um I guess, yeah, it's kind of, that sort of does a bit, but, I mean, I love and hate Netlix, but I think for everyone it's the same kind of way and then it's something you do by yourself, it is like a lonely, lonely activity, although that being said, me and my flatmates do watch Netflix quite a lot together and that is actually really nice bonding time for us, often Sunday, Sunday nights we'll have like a big dinner, we'll sit around here and we'll like watch a movie on Netflix or something like that and that's actually quite like a nice, a nice bonding moment, because we'd talk and stuff like that over dinner and then we'll just kind of relax and watch the movie and that kind of stuff as well, but kind of yeah, it depends on the scenario you're doing it, but a lot of the time it is just watching it by yourself.

And how does that make you feel?

Makes me feel like I haven't achieved anything, makes me feel like pretty useless, like if I have just spent, I mean, it's the kind of thing, if I'm really hungover, then I'm like, I wasn't going to achieve anything anyway today, so I think, in that kind of scenario, it's fine, but then, there's sometimes, I've yeah, just literally wasted like four or five hours watching Netflix when I could have been doing something like looking for other jobs, drawing and it does, it does make you feel like you haven't achieved anything and I feel like it could be quite, quite, just that feeling of not achieving anything, I feel like contributes to your lack of motivation as well. So, you know, I feel like motivation kind of works on a momentum build up thing, like you start doing something and you're doing it really well and you start being proud of yourself for doing it, so you keep doing more and it like builds up the motivation; whereas I think Netflix it's kind of completely the opposite a little bit and you're like 'oh, I'm so comfortable in bed, why would I start doing something else right now?' So, it's not, I think like, the only times I don't feel bad after watching it, is if I'm really hungover, and I wouldn't have been able to do anything anyway, but it's kind of yeah, I just feel very unfulfilled after watching Netflix, but I still watch a lot so it's got me, but yeah.

You want to say more about that, about that box?

Hmm... no I think, I think I've probably said everything.

Sure, can we talk about what you've put in the fourth box?

Yeah, so the fourth box, I guess is, it was kind of a, kind of similar to the wall, but more, it's  that like back and forth of trying to, trying to get out there, um and it, it is that kind of like scary, sharp, I guess it's the kind of you go, you go, get up to the edge then you're like 'okay, no, I can't, I can't go out there, not going to do that', and then you come back and it's kind of yeah, just that constant back and forth, I guess, just with yourself on like a... very, yeah, just, just how it can seem quite, I'm trying to think of a good way to phrase it, quite, um, yeah just quiet, just like sharp and scary I guess and it's constantly, yeah, you go up to that edge of being about to do something and then I think just being so close to something sometimes scares you away, whether it's people, jobs anything else like that, just be, yeah being like really, once you get close to something, I think the more scarier it becomes, but then once you get past that, then you realize it's not, but I think it's, yeah, it's the closer you get, it's, kind of feels like a constant back-and-forth of you building yourself up to do something and then and then you turn yourself around like last minute, I think, yeah, that's what I was trying to get with like, with that drawing.

So, basically, you're saying that, like out there can be tough, it can be...

Yeah, I think more, I think more like that drawing, because I guess in some ways, I guess it's kind of similar to the wall drawing again, as well, I guess that kind of thing, but I think more this one, I was just, I guess, to kind of, just that like back and forth of how like scary and sharp and like how things might seem like they might be painful, um and just yeah, I guess that like once you get up close to, yeah people or anything, it's kind of, yeah, that's when they seem the scariest I guess um or to, I think, scariest to yourself, I think, like them themselves are not scary, but kind of what you are doing in relation to it or them or whatever um and then you kind of retreat back, back into your little safety thing, little safety net, yeah, yes it just, kind of similar to the wall, when you think about it, but.

When you, when you, when you've put like going back and forth, you mean like a trial back and forth? Can you tell me more about that?

Um... yeah, I guess, just kind of the, yeah, I guess, it's kind of more the mental building up to do things, I think, just that internal 'right, I am going to do it' and then you're like 'okay, wait, no, maybe I shouldn't do it', 'gonna do it', 'no, I won't', and then kind of that constant back and forth because, because of different reasons and everything else and it's kind of, it's just a kind of an on, ongoing thing and you kind of have to keep going back and forth a couple of times before you kind of finally force yourself to go do something, get out there, get close to someone or something like that, I think it's just kind of a mental, mental thing that you're constantly going back and forth making up all these tiny little reasons why you shouldn't be doing something, um and then yeah, or I don't know, yeah, I think there are all these reasons that you shouldn't be doing something, or the world is telling you that there's all these reasons you shouldn't be doing something and then it's just a constant back and forth until you finally, I guess, break through, in your own way.

So, having that sort of chatterbox, having that mental 'should I message that person or should I not?' or 'should I apply for that job, or should I not?', all of that sort of back and forth thinking, makes you, contributes to your loneliness.

I think so, yeah, as in, it's kind of as in, again, it just makes me less, it's more kind of, it's the kind of thing that I do, that all within myself and I might not, I don't really tend to talk to people about my issues, I'll tend to kind of keep that all very bottled up in myself and so it's kind of that mental back and forth in my head, which means I take a lot longer to make decisions, I think um and that has like stopped me from doing certain things, meeting people, stopped me from working and I think it's, it's kind of, it just keeps me into myself, rather than I could be talking to friends about it, or I could be, you know, help getting advice or something like that, it is kind of just that, yeah, I think that it's what, part of what is prohibiting me from I guess making connections with certain people or things, I guess, just that constant 'oh, should I do it? Should I not? Should I do it?', um and I guess yeah, that's a big part of, I guess, yeah, making me feel, I guess, the sense of loneliness.

And how do you feel about that? How does that make you feel?

I guess like a little bit disappointed in myself, um, a little bit disappointed in myself because I'm like, all the time I'm kind of like 'oh, why couldn't I suck up and just do it?', and I kind of, I just yeah, I just, I know, on reflection things aren't as hard as they seem, or as scary as they seem, but it is just definitely, I think a big thing is not talking it through with other people, that has stopped me from doing it, um and so I think I feel a little bit disappointed in myself because I haven't done that and I guess going back to that whole kind of like independence thing that like I pride myself on, so anytime I'm kind of stopped from making connections with people or you know doing certain things, I think, I definitely do feel a little, um yeah, just a little, not ashamed, um, just, I don't know, kind of just, yeah I've failed myself, I guess, and it's not, not something I like to particularly feel that often, I guess, yeah, but just because I've wasted so much time in my own back and forth, yeah that's just stopped me from being able to do certain things, I think, but yeah.

When you said certain things, can you tell me more about that?

Hmm... I think whether it's putting myself out there for new jobs or going out, even just to different events, going out to go meet new people, um yeah, I think there's definitely like times like and with me like, I'm really into music and now I'm going into radio, I'm kind of getting on the edge of 'do I want to get into the music industry?', um and it's kind of like, there have been a lot of times where I'm just like 'I should have just gone to that thing, I should have', you know, like for example the other week there was like a festival I really wanted to go to, couldn't find, there weren't any friends to go with and I kind of just kept on making up all these excuses, I was like 'oh, it's meant to be maybe raining' and 'oh, it's like 40 pounds, probably shouldn't be spending 40 pounds on the ticket' and all this kind of stuff and I was like 'I probably, I should have just gone'. I had a visual idea beforehand, I was going to go with my camera and just like chat to people when I was there, um but then I kind of psyched myself out, I guess from doing it and I was kind of 'I should have just gone', but that's just like a very recent example of something like that or but it's always just, I always find that back and forth, I do it up until the point that it becomes too late, I think, so then I miss out on yeah, either, even or, for example, I don't know, going to the gym, for example, as well, I'll be like 'oh, but I can't go because my leg hurts', all this kind of stuff and then I won't go for two weeks and after having not gone for two weeks, I'll be like 'oh, I can't go now like because I haven't gone in two weeks, it would be embarrassing to show my face'. So just that kind of like I think it's definitely hindered a lot of things that I probably should have done or not necessarily probably should have done, but could have done easily and I think they may have been a benefit to me, but... yeah.

Thank you, is, do you want to say more about that?

Um... *pause* I think no, I think that's all, that mostly covered I think from that drawing there, yeah.

Okay, thank you so much. I'm going to pause the recording.

Can we talk about what you've put in the first box, please?

Yeah, um... so that was the place that I feel most socially connected and that was, I had done a Lidl and then I decided to change it to the local off-license because I probably spend more time there and then I guess it's kind of going on that same theory that I'll talk about, but I guess the local off-license, um because I'd probably go in there about three, four times a week, I go in, I know all the people that work, a lot of the time there's always kind of the same customers in there as well, so, you know them and they'll always kind of stop and have a chat and be like 'oh, how's your day going', and everything else, even if you're not talking to them, you can hear some of the guys working there having conversations with other customers and you know, it's kind of, I don't know, maybe it's a bit sly, but kind of listening to other people's conversations a little bit and they're kind of talking about what they're doing and everything else and it's quite, I don't know, it's just very, a sense of comfort, because I know them but it's just, it's just quite nice to see a lot of people in that kind of immediate community area, all coming together and I don't know it's just like the simple things of buying something, but I guess because it is someone you talk to quite a lot, I guess, it's quite nice, but you kind of see it everywhere, doing, doing that, that kind of thing, even when I'm walking past, I'll still give like a little wave when I'm walking past kind of thing and, I don't know, it's quite nice, you like, you do feel like you're part of something, um and I guess, I had also done the local Lidl as well, because I go to Lidl a lot, but I figured this, the off-licence was probably a better example, because I tend to go there a little bit more and it's closer, um but yeah, I think it's just having that recognition from someone else, as in them recognizing you and you also recognizing them as well makes it really a big part of kind of feeling connected, I think more than just, yeah more than just walking on the street kind of thing, so.

You mentioned recognition, can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, I mean, I guess, it's a, I mean, obviously, their recognition of you is on a very kind of just arbitrary level, it's just, you're somebody who comes into the shop a lot, it's not like you're friends or anything like that, but there's still something, it makes you feel kind of special, being recognized, I think it makes you feel like that you're noticed and it, I guess same for them, as well, and then just being asked how your day was by them can be like quite a nice thing, it's, it's and you know, they'll sometimes, if I've told them something the week before, they'll ask me about how that went, kind of thing and it's, it's, you know, if that happens with your housemates, they're your housemates, you see them everyday, of course that's going to happen, um but like it's quite, it's quite nice knowing they could like, they could, for example, just be like 'oh, hi, this will be 10 pounds fifty', kind of thing, but they're not, um and there really is that kind of sense of community and sometimes they'll, they're always kind of laughing and joking and then you'll kind of start laughing with one of the other customers, because the main guy Aziz said something stupid and like, I don't know, it's just a really nice kind of atmospheres, there's always like kids and stuff in there as well and just always, always kind of nice, nice atmosphere and then yeah, I just, I think that notion of being recognized by someone... who's not your friend because they should be, I think, if that makes sense, it's quite, it's just quite nice, even just yeah, even if I'm just waving at him or one of them from like the other side of the road, even that's like quite nice, kind of just having that, makes you have a sense of, I think, belonging to the area as well, yeah, which I think is really, really nice.

Hmm, you also mentioned that you feel like a part of something.

Yeah, well it makes you feel like you're a part of the, part of the community, it's a kind of, as in there have been multiple times that I've been standing behind someone else and they've been talking about things that have been going on, recently, or just like things that they've seen happen out of the shop window and even if you're not part of that conversation, it's kind of you're seeing all this or hearing about all this stuff that you might not have heard about otherwise and I think yeah, just yeah, makes you feel like you are part of the community, which I think is a really nice feeling and it is so easy to not feel part of the community, if you've only, for example, for me, like, I've only lived in this house for about a year and I think, yeah, for me, it's a really nice thing to have, it's like, you know, we kind of, I look back at my childhood house and my childhood neighbourhood, where I knew a whole bunch of people lived on the street and everything else and we had like Christmas parties for the street every year and, you know, I knew all the people, the local cafes, everything else like that and it's kind of, but obviously I lived there for 20 years and my parents lived there for longer than that as well, um so then coming to a new city, I think that was like a very important thing for me to have because it does make you feel just like a lot more comfortable in the local area and, you know, like, you know, if, I don't know, let's say for example, obviously, I could always come home, but like let's say for example, one of my flatmates went crazy and I need to run off for help, like I know I could just go across the road and go into the shop and they would be able to help me and I would trust them to help me and they do actually help us with stuff like fixing doors and everything else, as well, so that's how it is, but no it is, it is, it is kind of, I think just having that, you know, there's a network I think, a network in the local area that you can trust I think and that makes it really quite nice, a nice thing and um it's like the neighbours, we kind of know the neighbours, but like not well enough, like if I see them we'll say hi, but that's the extent of it, um so, it is kind of nice having that connection to the community and I think, it really is kind of like a big, that shop, in particular, is a kind of big glue for the local community, as everyone, like a lot of people go there all the time and I think everyone has like, has quite a similar relationship with the owners there, um, but I think, I don't know, everyone, everyone knows that and everyone appreciates that and everyone in the era seems to quite like it, I don't know, people like I, obviously, people walk in and call him by his first name and stuff, a couple of guys who work there and stuff, and I think it's, it does create a sense of community, which is really nice.

You mentioned trust, can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, it's not like I wouldn't, you know, if I broke up with a boyfriend I wouldn't go to them for that kind of thing, but just knowing like if, for example, there had to be someone to come into the garden or something like that, and like we needed them or like we needed someone to be there, but they couldn't or like someone to hold a package for us or something like that, like I would trust them to do that, like if I had a very important package coming and I couldn't be here for it and no one else was in, I would be like 'oh, put it, can you give it to 'Cas'', and they would be like 'yeah, sure, that's fine, like you can leave it with us' and like, I know that I could trust them and I think I'm not like, I highly doubt there would be a time when I ever do need them for that, but just knowing that it is there, that I can trust them, is quite like, it does give a kind of sense of security, um like yeah, quite yeah, just makes you feel a bit, yeah, you have got someone you can trust on, which is, I think, a good thing to have in the community, because I think a lot of communities probably don't, I feel like we're quite lucky to have the 'Cas', as it's called.

Thank you, and how does that make you feel? Hmm *pause*

As in, do you mean as in...

Like, when you said that like you have, um like your, this local place that you go to and knowing that you can trust these people and then someone had that, how does that impact things and stuff?

Um... I guess for me like, it makes me, it just makes me feel quite comfortable in the area, I think, um, I know I can always kind of go in and have a joke with him, like not that I would hang out with them, but just, I think those small social interactions are quite important, like obviously, you have your main relationships with your friends and family and everything else, but I think it's like, it's also quite important to have those kinds of smaller side relationships with people, even if it's just kind of people who just passed, kind of regularly, I think, it's, I think it's little things, those little things that people take for granted and I don't know, I think for me, it just makes me feel quite, yeah just makes me feel very comfortable in the area, um, I don't know, it's, it's just, it's just like kind of a nice, a nice feeling, I guess, you feel connected to something, um, you're not just someone who's passing through, you're not just another customer, so it does just make you feel a little bit, I don't know, just yeah, it makes you feel nice, I guess.

Did you want to say anything else?

Um... I mean, I guess the only thing besides the fact that I was going to say the Lidl before, I was going to say the Lidl, anyway, even though the Lidl like I wouldn't probably trust them, but I think there's still that is, that sense of community in the same kind of sense that like I would say hello to a lot of them, I recognize all the people who work there, I recognize a lot of customers who go in there, because I probably go to Lidl like most days, when I'm walking to or from work and I think it's, it's slightly different isn't it? It's not on as much as a personal level as it is with the 'Cas', but I still think that is quite a big like important space in the, um... community for just, just those really small interactions of recognition I think, it's on a two slightly different scales, but I think it's also a very important place, but I guess yeah, that was just... same kind of thing, but less, less, kind of small, but yeah, but I think that's all I wanted to say on that.

Thank you so much, can we move on to the next box, please?

Yes, so the next one I said, I said Victoria Park but under like certain, so it's like a big park, I don't know how well you know the area, um, I said Victoria Park but only kind of in certain circumstances, like they do a lot of festivals and that kind of stuff and if you go there for a festival that's a very different vibe. So, I guess, I think I was specifically talking about like normally when I go for like a run in the morning, um, and I'll run around the park and it's just kind of, it feels, I don't know, for me personally, I'm there with my headphones in, so that's obviously one step that makes me feel quite disconnected from everyone else, but and then I guess, with me, it's all running, like I'm going quite fast, past everyone, but same with, in that Park, as well, there's a lot of other people running, there's a lot of people and bicycles and normally, in the morning, there's no people like leisurely strolling around, it's all kind of people trying to get somewhere and you do just feel, I don't know, I think, it's just som-, because you're just so fast, going past everyone, um, and everyone's kind of like in their own, own little world, it's the kind of thing that like, if you would have stopped someone there, just to say 'hello', I mean, not that you would do that anyway, but you get the feeling that they would be annoyed at you, you just get that like 'oh, I don't want to interrupt these people, doing these things, because I feel like it would be annoying'. I mean, you could say that about most people, in most places but, you know, like a lot of the time I feel like when people just, just in that kind of like specific time frame in the park, but I guess people are trying to get somewhere or do something, no one it's just there for like a leisurely stroll, it's kind of yeah, you get quite, not intimidating, intimidating isn't the right word, not intimidated, but it's just that you get, you get that feeling, yeah, that you would annoy them, if you stop them or go in their way or something like that, and it feels very, it makes you feel very kind of, I don't know, that you just, yeah, I don't want to get in anyone's way and everything else, um I guess. Yeah, that's kind of the main thing about that, but then obviously a couple of times in Victoria Park, when you hang out with your friends and it's a Sunday afternoon, there's lots of people like leisurely strolling around, there's no one trying to get to work, very different, very different vibe. So, I don't know if that's specifically to do with the place, but that's just what I can think of, I guess, um with that, yeah.

When you said that basically you don't want to upset people or you don't want to annoy people, can you tell me more about that?

It's not, it's just that you get, you just get a feeling that if, if you would have just kind of, I don't know, for example, when you're going in, if like, you're going on a Sunday afternoon walk, with a couple of friends or like even just by yourself, or you're going on like a hike somewhere, like, quite often when you walk past people, you feel like 'oh, morning or afternoon', or something like that, but it's the kind of thing like, I feel like if I was to do that, then people just give me like weird looks, to be fair like, I'm running, I'm not going to stop and say that, but like, let's say I had gone for a walk in the park at 6 a.m. in the morning, not that I'm going to do that, but if I had done that and if I was just walking past and I go like 'oh, morning' to people, they kind of just be like 'what? Why? Why are you saying 'morning' to people? Why?' like, kind of thing, and I think, it's just very, yeah, it's just *pause* people seem to be not open to that kind of, I guess, interaction, maybe because it's too early or something like that, could be that people are tired and they just want to get their run done or they want to get to work or whatever else, but it is, you do just feel very, yeah, disconnected from everyone that like you don't even want to try, because they probably would be grumpy, but yeah.

So, you feel most lonely there because you feel that people are grumpy.

Yeah, it's like lonely, in the sense that, it makes me feel more lonely I think than when I'm just sitting at home, because you are passing so many people, it's like the kind of hole like so close yet so far, it's kind of that whole thing like, you feel so disconnected from everyone, everyone has their own little world, listening to their own music, going past, fast, really, going past really fast and everything else, but you see so many people and I'm like I love, I love people watching, but it's kind of, like when I'm doing that like, I don't even have time to kind of imagine in my head what those, that person might be like, which is, you know, something I kind of do if I'm walking around or sort of sitting at a cafe and watching people go past, you know, it's like a little thing I do in my mind like, you kind of create in your mind what that person might be like or even like I, if I am walking to work I, you know, I often like smile at people, I mean, not all the time, because London's people don't smile that much but like, you know, I often smile to people when I'm walking past them, or, you know, just like giving a little nod or something like that, um, and it's kind of, I don't know, you do, even just that little, small, little nod, I think, it makes like a big, big difference of it, whereas just like that, at that point in the park, in the morning, it's just you don't get that of anyone really, everyone's just so focused and doing their own thing that, I don't know, they just don't want to look up, I think, from their own little world, but.

So, people just focusing on their own thing and...

Yeah, it could be, and, and it's very much, I don't know, just because they are, like you see so many kind of interesting people and it's kind of, I'm sure that a lot of them are really lovely, nice people, but because you do get that, that vibe of like, oh, there's a little bit also, as well, maybe, like a little bit of like competitiveness as well, I've noticed, like a lot of like athletic guys, as well, like kind of, I notice they will speed up to like overtake you and to like kind of like show off a little bit and you do kind of notice there's that slight, little like competitiveness among people, like running in the park and it's just, it's not, I don't know, there's just not that kind of like a friendly, not that it is unfriendly, it's just not particularly friendly, so and I think, I don't know, for me like, I just do, I just do notice that and there's just so many people and I'm like, I'd actually, I'm like so interested into like knowing what all you people are like, but obviously it's never going to happen and, and so it's just you, it's kind of just, being surrounded by all these people that you're sure are really nice, but just like feeling kind of very rejected by all of them, not that you should have a reason to be accepted by them, but it is just that sense of 'don't talk to me, even though you don't know them', you don't know anything, but there's still that sense of just like there being a lot of people, but that sense of just absolutely like not, yeah, no acceptance from anyone, I guess, in a very just like a physical, physical manner, um but yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

I mean, it's like, it does create a physical feeling of kind of disconnected from people and loneliness, but it's like, at the same time, I do understand why it is, it is, just because people will have their own things to do and they've got places to be and it's like, you know, it's not because they personally don't like you or have a vendetta against you or anything like that, but it, it, you can't just help but feel like, I don't know, it kind of makes me feel *pause* dis-, disappointed maybe, as in I think human interaction is a beautiful thing and I think people take it for granted and I miss, I don't know maybe because London is specifically bad at it as well, but I do miss just like the little like saying 'hi' to people on the street, even if I like barely knew them and that kind of stuff, or it's like that, it doesn't really happen here that much, um, and I think, I think, it's, I think, I don't know, I guess, yeah  slightly disappointed and it's kind of like, you could be having all these nice like interaction with people and you never know, it's the kind of thing like sometimes a smile can make someone's morning really different, like you never know, um and so, I guess, it's just kind of disappointing, because it's like, I feel like I'm missing out and I feel like you guys are missing out on all this stuff as well, but obviously, you can't change like that's not going to change anytime soon. So, I don't know, I guess, yeah just disappointed that there isn't more of that interaction, I think.

Is there anything else you want to say about that?

I think no, I think I've probably said all I could say about that.

Okay, great, thank you so much, I'm gonna stop the recording.
