I'll leave this here, if you don't mind *pause* Thank you, so, um, can we start by talking about what you put first, please?

Yeah, sure, so I've, the first box I've put um a broken heart, um to do the idea about loss of love um in the experience of loneliness and that can be within family loss... of love or relationship-wise, or friendship-wise, you know, um I feel like, um, well in my, in my experience, loneliness has stem from being distance, distant from people who I've once had such a close relationship before, in you know, different categories, so I'd say, love does have a big factor in loneliness, yeah.

So, you're saying that when you, let's say, lose a close relationship, you mentioned your, your family close relationship, like friendships and maybe something like a personal relationship, um can you tell me more about them, please?

Hmm.

Maybe we can start by talking about the family one.

So, the family, um, so just certain family members that I have grown up with, that you lose... you lose all at once, I'd say, so quite in a short period of time, it leads to me feeling lonely, because it just feels like everybody's leaving you at once, kind of thing. So it's like, I'd, even though I do have a lot of family, but losing that many is like, you know, leads you to feeling so, um, just lost, I'm feeling like 'okay, well, you know, these are people that you see every day, another you don't see them, what am I supposed to do now?', kind of thing. So yeah, with friendships, because friendships are quite, you know, some friendships are quite grouply tied together, um especially, you know, for younger generations a lot of people just go with a lot of people's, you know, a lot of the group's idea of what to do between friendships, so, a lot of friendships that have been in, have sometimes lead to not just one person, but more than one person in a friendship group having the same idea of the one person that has an issue, so when everyone, all get against you, in one of your friendship groups, it's like, you generally feel very lonely, because you don't have anyone to speak to, because everything is just one-sided and yeah, it does get really lonely sometimes because you don't have anyone to speak to, a lot of your thoughts that get into your head, so it's like how you're expected, how do you, how do you expect to express how you feel? Um, and I feel like for younger generations, as well, it's quite hard to speak to adults about friendship groups because they just see it as 'oh, don't worry about it, you'll make new friends', all that kind of stuff, but I feel like that makes me even feel even lonelier, because it's like now my parents are not even listening to me when I try to speak about it, so it's like now I feel genuinely lonely because the only person I can speak to is myself, yeah.

Mmh, so when, when you feel like, you know, people don't listen to you or that people are not listening to you, you associate that with loneliness.

Yeah.

Tell me more about that.

Um, so it's just like not being able to voice how you actually feel and being understood, a lot of the time it's quite... ignored, because some situations are not seen as serious stuff, so that just becomes a problem because you want somebody to actually understand, whilst listening to you, um but obviously people can't see the thoughts that you have in your head or hidden thoughts that you have in your head and there's only so much you can say out loud that will make them understand, so for them to not, sometimes it's a bit selfish to say you want them to approach it the way you'd want them to, and expect you to listen to them the way you'd want them to, but it is a fragile moment when you do experience stuff like that, so when no one's listening to you and people actually have the opportunity to, it does get a bit, yeah, it is, it is a very lonely feeling, a very lonely feeling.

And um, you mentioned that when you are with your friends or um, it becomes one-sided, can you tell me more about that, please?

Hmm so, I would say like, again a lot of the other generation, um friendship groups are quite, some friendship groups are quite big, some friendship groups are quite small and  let's just say, if one person had a problem in the friendship group and you know, they've gone and told everyone else in their friendship group, this person that have done this to, a lot of the time, it's a lot of, you know, unconscious bias, pick side basis, so they would obviously, you know, side with somebody whose obviously explained how they feel and only listen to one side of the thing, so they'll obviously just you know outcast you, what's my next... marginalize you and um just make you feel lonely without even speaking to you, as well, so it's like they're not even, you know, seeing both sides of the story, so when they just listen to one person it's like 'okay, well you are foregone about, we don't care about you anymore, until that person becomes your friend again, we'll be your friend again'. So yeah, even though it shouldn't be like that, sometimes it's like that because, um again, I don't know, there is a lot of different factors that you could say that's the reason, because we know, maybe favoritism, or you know, just how they see you as a person, I don't know, but yeah sometimes it does get that bad.

So when, when, so when, for example, you know a group of friends or some friends take one side that can lead to feeling loneliness?

*agrees*

Okay, um and, and how does that make you feel?

Yeah, it does make me feel kind of, you know, upset because, you know, a lot of, especially with friendship groups, a lot of people that you call your friends become kind of a family as well, you do create that kind of relationship with them where you do anything with them, so it's like, especially as you get older, you'd expect people to want to be able to talk things through more and understand more, but I guess people just can't really, just can't really do that, so yeah, I get, I do get quite upset and it does kind of take a long time for me to get over it, because, um, I have to see these people on social media all the time, you know, doing stuff together, when I'm at home like 'oh gosh, like I wish I was with them, if we didn't have this problem'. So yeah, that's how it is.

Tell me about social media?

Social media? Um... in terms of friendship groups?

So for example when said you see some, you see your friends in social media and you're not there, tell me about that.

Oh, so like, I don't know, something like Snapchat, you'd be able to see different, yeah you'd be able to see like your friends posting whatever they're doing at that current time and yes, just for everyone to see, and it's just like, it's kind of like an in-your-face, kind of thing, and I feel like social media just kind of give a lot of negative connotations, because you're seeing it from quite a negative perspective, but they are, they're actually just enjoying themselves, do you know what I mean? So it's like, we um, I don't know, I just feel like, that's why me personally, I always call social media quite toxic, because it actually just leads to so many problems, because it doesn't give the real image of what the actual reality is, it's like a hyper reality, yeah that's how I see social media. I feel like social media does ruin a lot of friendship groups, because of stuff like that, like if I'm seeing, if I'm at home and I'm seeing all my friends out and maybe my friends wanted to do something that I didn't, that I know I didn't like, but I'm begging and we're like 'why didn't you invite me? Why did you do this? Why did you do that?', but that's because even though they're posting it for themselves, because they want everyone to see, but I'm just viewing it as they're coming to post it to make me jealous, do you know what I'm trying to say? But even though that's not what it's like, so yeah, I don't know why sometimes I think like that or other people do think like that, but it's just how it is, yeah.

Social media can make you or anyone feel adequate, inadequate, you know what I mean?

Yeah.

And when, and when you see, for example, like your friends doing something and you weren't invited to, that can make you feel jealous...

Yeah, jealous or just like kind of upsetting and gets you questioning how you value yourself in a friendship or how you value yourself as a person, 'do they like me? Don't they like me?', kind of just asking a lot of questions and it does give you kind of a low mood, because it's like... that one little thing brings so many questions about yourself and then, I feel like that's why, Iike again, a lot of people they start to gain a lot of like low self-esteem and depression and stuff like that, because they put so many thoughts in their head that, and a lot of questions that they only allow themselves to answer and it's not healthy for you, it's not healthy for your mind, so yeah, yeah.

Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say?

No

Okay... okay, can we talk about what you've put in box two, please?

So I've put money, um I feel like the way money is used and distributed can make people feel very, very lonely, because money is evil, especially if you have a lot of it, and a lot of people who have money don't, who have a lot of money don't know how to use it very well and it leads to you doing, being asked, I think, I feel like money leads to you being lonely, because you're so used to, a lot of people that I know that use a lot of money for themselves, for themselves, for themselves, for themselves, doing a lot of things, using a lot of money for negative things for themselves, like drugs and all that kind of stuff that you know like, you don't do drugs with people, you do not, some people do, but a lot of people do drugs, you know, just by themselves, in their own peace, because a lot of the time they don't even want people to know that they're doing it and, um yeah, I just feel like money makes you very selfish, so when that selfishness comes in and people see you as that kind of person, they don't want to associate yourself with that person, and I feel like money makes people very, very unhappy, because money genuinely pushes people away because if it's not being used properly and if it's not, you know, taken for granted, then I don't know, I've just seen it, I see it with celebrities, I see it with people that I know that money makes people really, really unhappy and it keeps them very isolated from the real world and yeah, money is, it's a big problem.

Hmm, so um, so if you have a lot of money and um, then you start to become selfish... you said something about selfishness, can you tell me more about that, please?

Um... so having a lot of money can lead to you doing a lot of things just for yourself and for a lot of people, there are a lot of people around them that, or a lot of things that they could be doing around them that money could, if you have a lot of it, money could be used properly, so like in terms of helping out family members, who are not as, you know, as well off as you or, you know, charities and stuff like that, so when you have so much money and you're just binging it for stuff like, people who, people, a lot of people have money, but I feel like there's even statistics, a lot of people, a lot of people who have money are the ones that are always like high and alcoholic percentages and stuff like that. So it's like a lot of the time people use stuff and abuse stuff, ironically that, you know, will either kill them or just keep them happy in their eyes, but it's a negative, um it's obviously a negative thing for everyone else because for example, what I'd say within my experience of my, like I have a friend who had a lot of money or started to get a lot of money in, and they started to become friends and associate themselves with people, who obviously had a lot of money, as well, so it wasn't even the thing where we, as a friendship group, were pushing that person away, that person just felt more, better hanging out with people more well off, so, obviously I'm saying that's selfish because what has money got to do with friendship? What does it have to do with how you see other people? Especially when you started off exactly like us. Now, being in that friendship group with all the people who are, who are well-off you can see the change in activities that they used to do and once they realized that that wasn't for them, that wasn't them, and they obviously decided to stop doing what they were doing before and they're old friends or us didn't want to be friends with them again, that loneliness comes in, because you had all this money and he was using it for the wrong things, he was a different person before this money and now you've led yourself in this position where you have all this money, but you have no friends, so you don't know what to do with it. So, you know, I feel like it can drive people quite crazy in different ways if it's just not used properly, but I feel like that stems from that, I see it as a problem with the education system, because like me being, you know, just coming out of it, like I would be, we were never taught how to manage money or we were not taught about taxes, mortgages, stuff like that, so when all the money is coming like 'oh my gosh, like what am I doing with it?', do you know what I mean? So, that's important, key stuff that we have to manage in our lives that we don't know, it's supposed to be basic skills, but we don't even get taught about it, which is why when young people get money, it's used for a lot of different things which is, which is quite sad, but yeah, that's how I see it, loneliness.

So, you're saying that when, for example, you know, your friends didn't have a lot of money at the beginning, but then they became quite wealthy, earning a lot, but then they started to spend the money for themselves and then they became selfish and they lost friendships in that period and then, that makes them feel lonely, in a way.

Yeah.

Okay, um, and, and if, and, okay, for example, let's say, let's say you had a lot of money and, and how does that make you feel like in connection to loneliness?

If I had a lot of money?

Yeah.

If I had a lot of money, um, I don't know if me and money would... loneliness, not me personally, I think, I just see, well, I would say maybe there was a time when I did get my new job and I was a bit 'okay, I can only do this with certain people', I was picking and choosing certain people to go out with and there were people that were upset with me and they stopped speaking to me, I had that phase of 'okay now, I'm kind of, not rich, but now I've got money, I can do these certain things that other people can't do because they're not on my level', which led to me feeling lonely because people wanted to stop speaking to me, because I felt like I was pushing them out, which wasn't what I was doing, but again I feel like a lot of the time, people when, they forget that when you have a lot of money, you don't want to ask them to do certain things, when you know that they can't do it. So, I think the way that it gets presented across sometimes isn't clear and it's hard for you to make it clear without rubbing it in, it's hard for you to not make it clear without, in asking them, asking certain people to do stuff with you, so it's like, I think when it comes to money in order to not lead to that loneliness, that's just like, you know, you have to be very, very wise and you know not take it for granted and just because money can be easily lost as well. So yeah, I've just seen it in other people more, but I have, I do have an idea of how money has made me feel, in a quite, but then you can also say that having no money, as well, leads to feeling lonely, as well, because you won't be able to do the things that you wish you could do and it's always 'I have to stay at home, stay at home, stay at home, stay at home' *says quickly* and especially if you're quiet a social person like me, staying at home is not somewhere you'd always want to be, so it's like you're not lonely just from not being with your friends or family but lonely more from being outside in society, kind of thing, yeah.

Hmm, so, so, so like not having money can also make you feel lonely because...

You just, you can just, there's a lot of things that you wish you could do to make yourself happy, with other people, just little stuff like, you know, group of friends' holiday or just having a nice meal out with certain people, nothing too like exaggerated, just small things, just basic things that if you can't do, you just question yourself like 'why am I his position?', like, you know, 'why can't I be like them?', kind of thing, you just, you know, you do get quite lonely, always doing the bare minimum or having the bare minimum, away from everyone else around you, especially if you're the only one, if there's no one you can relate to, then it's like 'okay, this is just me, Why do I feel like this?'

Okay, thank you. Okay, is there anything else you'd like to add?

To one of the boxes or just...

No, no, just in that.

Oh, no.

Okay, can we start talking about what you've put in the third box, please?

I've put outcast um, I was going to say because, see the thing is, I feel like outcast, my third box and my fourth box are quite similar, but just outcast and just being different can lead you to... um... feeling lonely and less like, you know, being, like for me, I'd say being black *laughs a bit* can lead to me feeling quite lonely, sometimes especially me being scared to go into University, outside of London, or going into London where a lot of ethnic minority groups are quite smaller, especially I know with UCL, even though it's quite International, but if you still break it down into race, like the percentages of ethnic minorities or for my ethnic minority is quite low or somewhere like I applied to like Durham, which is very, very far, you know, the percentages are very, very low, so that kind of loneliness of just not having that kind of community with you to kind of have that understanding, um, of where you're from and stuff like that, even though there are people there, that's not to do with racism, but there are people there that you know, oh, you know, respectful, everyone is equal, everyone's role commitment is equal, but I feel like because it's, it is heavily predominated, like for example somewhere like Durham University is heavily white populated, ethnically they won't feel lonely because they can relate, because they have the same, not the same identity, but they have, they can relate to people who have the same skin color as them, whereas with me, my loneliness as well is feeling like I don't belong here, so like 'what am I doing here?', if anything, um, also, as well, with like sexuality, a lot of controversy with how, um different, um, you know, yeah having a different, different sexuality is, there's the whole LGBTs and some people might feel lonely because they don't feel accepted in society, um and yeah, that just leads you to feeling lonely because they just want what a lot of people just want, you know, just to feel accepted and welcomed and yeah or even in like, again, just coming out of the education system now coming into work it is a big step, so it's like, now it's just working, working, working and normally, just always seeing your friends everyday, it's now working for people and hardly seeing anybody, because they're just in work, work, work, work, work, it does get you feeling a bit lonely because that, that's when the happiness, the self-happiness comes in, you know, like I would rather be doing what I want to be doing, so I have more free time to see the people that I want and enjoy my life a bit, but when you're just constantly in work, it's like, it just feels like a routine control system and, you know, even not, hardly seeing family, as well, can lead you to being quite, like if you're always working, leads you to feeling quite lonely, when your parents play a big factor in your life and you hardly get to see them knowing that as they get older, you know, time's running out for them, so, it's like yeah, just leaves me feeling.

Thank you, you mentioned a few things, you mentioned race, so being in minority from a race perspective, can make you feel lonely, you mentioned sexuality, so being from LGBT, for example, background can make you, some may make them feel lonely, not being accepted in a way can make you feel lonely. Can you tell me more about, you know, can you tell me more about that, when you're not accepted and that leads to loneliness for you?

Hmm, so, for example, how am I going to say this? I work in a very, um yeah, I work in a very masculine setting and me, again being part of the LGBT can be can make me feel very lonely because I don't have the same, you know, attributes as all the masculine men that work in the same place as me and there is a big difference between the way I speak and the way they speak, and the way that they have their bunter and the way I have my bunter, the way that they dress and the way that I dress, even though we're supposed to wear the same thing, but we were it in different ways, so it's like I get, I do feel lonely because, especially when I just feel like I'm mostly looked down upon because I'm not exactly the same as everyone else, so that can yeah, it does get quite lonely because you're just feeling like, it's not lonely because there's no one around me to make me feel better, it's more lonely because I am the only one, so, I don't think that I would feel like that, if there were more people like me in that setting that could be like, you know what, I don't even, though I don't need more people to embrace who I am more, but it does get a bit overwhelming when there's a lot of people who are exactly the same and just one of you isn't and it's like, how do I get myself to stop feeling lonely? Do I have to blend in with them by doing exactly what they're doing or, you know, carry on feeling this way and just get the money? But again, what's the point of going to work unhappy every single day? It's not, it's not good for you, so yeah, that's just a lonely feeling, yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Hmm, do you know what? It does, it does make me feel kind of, kind of crap, kind of sad, um it's not nice, um, but I feel like when it comes to stuff like that, there's a few things that you just can't, you know, do yourself, like you can't change people's opinions, you can't make people act a certain way to make you feel better, you can't, you know, or you most definitely shouldn't change yourself, in order to, um, conform or make other people wanna like you, um so, but I know, at the same time I don't feel like people should just deal with it, so, I mean I will be leaving soon because I would want to work somewhere where I feel more accepted and happy and where my work colleagues would actually want to talk to me, um, yeah, but I mean, I feel like in this society that we just live in, like with me, as much as I feel that way, I'm just like 'well, I have bills to pay, I have money to go to some places, so I'm just going to work like this until I find something better that comes along the way', do you know what I mean? Like it's not, I just yeah, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger, so that's how I see it, yeah, yeah.

Thank you, um and you also mentioned something about your family, that time is running out, you're not seeing them as often, can you tell me more about that?

Hmm like because I was, I wasn't born here, but you know, I do have family back home, who you know are getting quite sick or getting quite old and you know, because going to Africa is really, really expensive, but, you know, having to check up on them from a very, very far distance isn't the same and I'd say that, you know, yeah like here it's only me, my mum, my dad and my brother, everyone else is back where we live, so it's like feeling lonely that everyone's kind of together, you know, they have a more family prospect than we do and it's like what do we do? Do we just move back or do we just, you know, keep on living here? But and I'd say, even here as well like, we're all, all of us are always working at different times and doing our own things, so family time is even quite, um, a struggle so I feel like everyone would feel lonely in their own way because we're just not together a lot of the time, like, yeah, even today I'm here and everyone else is in their own, going to church, going to this, going to that, so it's just like, the day in which everyone is not working and we're still not together, so it's just like, it's a shame, I mean, I don't feel lonely today, I'm just tired but, you know, it does, sometimes it does get like that like 'oh, when are you coming home?', 'I'm leaving soon' or 'I'm not going to be home until late', 'oh, okay, well, see you next week', do you know what I mean? So, yeah it does get a bit lonely.

And how does that make you feel?

Hmm, it makes me sad because I do, I would want to spend more time with them, but a lot of the circumstances are very understandable, so I don't get too frustrated over it, it would be different if they didn't want to even speak to me, but it is just, it's bearing everyone else, but, you know, like we are going on holiday together in the summer holiday, so we will enjoy our time like that, you know, those are the times that are most precious, so you get to invest more in that and everything you wanted to say when you couldn't say before you can say it then, so yeah.

Is there anything else you want to say about box three?

No.

Okay, um can you talk about what you've put in the fourth box, please?

Yeah, so in the fourth box, I kind of did put like just being different, kind of links to outcast, similar... not similar, but just being different I would say, like as in terms of, um, you know, like I would say when I was in, when I was in school, um I was different in terms of like I just, I wasn't a goody two-shoes, but I just always wanted to do well and I always wanted to get good grades, you know, and um, a lot of people just, you know, came to school and just wanted to hang out with friends and just be with people, but you being that person that just really, really wants to do well can just lead you kind of feeling lonely because nobody wants to be friends with that person. So yeah, I had a, there was a big lonely period where no one wanted to be friends with someone as serious as me, but then in the end we saw the results, so it's like, it was worth it, do you know what I mean? Um, so yeah, that's what I mean by difference and not just, even though yeah, there's ways, there's, you know, gender, something like that, but in terms of your own personality traits, yeah, you can get quiet lonely, yeah, that's, that's how I felt lonely when I was in school

Tell me more about personality traits?

Hmm, I don't know, maybe like. I'm not sure, this is like, you can, I don't know, in terms of like confidence and stuff, you know, not being as confident like others can like, in, because loneliness doesn't, yeah, expressed loneliness isn't just from... like society, society-wise, it can be like right there, in a moment, in a group or just in an, in an actual setting, you can be in a group of five people and if everyone else is, um you know, if everyone else is having a joke that you don't know about and you have no idea what to say, you automatically feel lonely because you don't get the same kind of feeling as they're or enjoyment as they're getting, so, I would say like, in terms of like, if I'm talking about personality traits, I'd say that, um, I wasn't as a confident person as before, yeah I will, not as a confident person as I could be saying, um, again, where I work you need quite a very big person-, confident personality trait and um again, I have like little experiences where I might try, you know, to say something, you know, because where I work is very social, so might come and say something and you know, there's always people speaking over you because their confidence has begun greater than mine and it's like that just brings down your self-esteem bit by bit, by bit, by bit and when you're surrounded by everybody who's more confident, because they feel like they have so much more power and they're just there like, 'well, I'm nothing like you guys', come to lunch break and they're all sitting together and you just go to the table by yourself. Sometimes I do like my own, my own company, but sometimes it's just like why can't I just have people or my own kind of not as confident group, and sit at a table, like sit at a table with them, just like them so, yeah it does, that's how I see in my, the workplace loneliness is like that for me because I'm just not as confident, so I can't really relate to everyone else or um I don't know, I really struggle to describe myself sometimes, yeah, I can't find the right personality traits for myself, but yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Yeah, it gets, does, does, yeah again, it's quite, it does feel quite sad, um... but, it's not, yeah, I'm, I'm just a person who brushes things under the rug, so it's not a big deal for me, a lot of the time I just see going to work as yeah, I'm there for a few hours, just deal with it and then I can do whatever I want afterwards, so.

So, being in an environment where you feel that other people don't necessarily relate to you um, but then you see their confidence is higher than yours, makes you feel lonely?

Yeah.

Tell me more about that.

Hmm... yeah, it's just like being yeah, just being in an environment where, um again, you're just so different to everyone else, um just makes you, again just question yourself, like you know 'do I belong here?', 'Why am I here?' 'Maybe this work place just isn't for me'. Um... so yeah, you just, it's just a lonely feeling knowing that you don't know or you don't get to value your place and that work-place, so that's just how I see it.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that box?

No.

I just want to go back to box one briefly, you mentioned something around family, friendships and partners, right? So, um I think you mentioned like something about, something around being lost, can you tell me more about that, please?

Hmm, so just in terms of being lost, just feeling like you don't know what to do or like how to move on in, in certain losses of love, so, you know, it's hard to get over a loss, a lot of the time and when you feel lost, you tend to not, a lost person doesn't, tends to not want to associate with a lot of people at the current time, so you're obviously quite isolated by yourself and you know, again, you just leave, you're left to question yourself a lot of things and asking yourself a lot of questions that you just don't have the capacity, capacity and brain to answer, so um yeah that lost feeling just doesn't, um yeah, just doesn't sit well and yeah just makes you feel quite, quite lonely and isolated, yeah.

So, you're saying that when you lose like someone special, someone that you love that makes you feel lost?

Yeah.

Tell me about that.

Hmm, so, um, I don't know and I haven't felt that way in quite a long time, but it's just, um yeah, it's just like you don't know how to feel, well, you might not be able to feel as happy as you did before, knowing that that person, situation will just always be in your mind, kind of thing, so, yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Yeah, it's not great, it's not nice, but in a way it's, it's, it's, it's not a feeling forever, so yeah, yeah.

Hmm, okay, is there anything else you want to say?

No, I'm fine.

Okay, thank you, I'm going to cancel the recording.

So, you mentioned that, um you know, you'd like to voice your, your opinion and, and, to someone but when you come home like, you know, there's not many people around. Can you tell me more about that?

Um, yeah, just because, just because, um, everyone's kind of busy, so it's not that when they're here I can't do it, it's just at the time that I'm feeling that feeling, it's very difficult to speak about anything when they're physically not there, um again, I'm just somebody who likes to speak up from face-to-face, I want to have the time to sit down and speak about stuff like that. So, yeah, it's very difficult to not voice your feelings when they're there, when you're feeling it, then having to wait, because the same things or thoughts or expressing how you're feeling, later on, when, obviously, you've calmed down, you might feel a bit better, but the thought is still in your head, is not going to be exactly the same, but I feel like a true reflection of how you feel will be seen through how you feel at that exact moment in time, so, yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Um... I don't, I don't feel upset, only because I know that everybody has different things they need to be doing in life, so, I do genuinely understand, it's just a feeling of 'oh, I did wish somebody was here', but yeah, it's not, I don't, I don't feel any way about it, it's only because, it's not like people are choosing not to be *recording is interrupted*

Thank you, so um can I have a quick look? Okay. Don't worry about, I'm sure it will go eventually *laughs*, so can we start by talking about what you've put first, please?

Hmm, so I've put friend's house, so I feel more socially connected there because a lot of my friends, we all come together when we go to each other's houses, we get to talk about a lot of things, happy things and things that might be upsetting us, um... and yeah, it's just, we have better communication when we're face-to-face, so, yeah, I feel more socially connected there because I actually get to interact with people around me and so.

So being with your friends makes you socially connected?

Yeah.

Tell me about that.

Um... just speaking, you know having conversation um and you know, I guess I would say in my friendship group we're all different, we have different um identities, so it's like, being socially connected with people, who are so different to you gives you kind of more like a, not a global perspective, but just a more, a range of different perspectives of different kinds of people, so it keeps you more, um just, just more aware of different things and just more social in social issues that they might be experiencing because of how they did their life that we get to challenge when we're speaking about and communicating about um so yeah, that's one of the things.

Hello *someone enters the room*

Hi.

How are you?

Good, how are you? *stranger probably left the room and did not answer* So, so just, yeah, so you said basically just um knowing, learning about other perspectives and different kind of inputs in a way makes you feel more socially connected.

Yeah.

Can you tell me more about that?

Hmm, so just the idea of, I feel like, yeah just being around, just being around friends can make you, um... I have no idea, maybe for me, just being around friends just makes me kind of talk more about um certain things and just, and it just keeps you more, it keeps my brain fresh because I get to, um challenge my brain from always being quiet. So, there's a lot of thoughts that I have in my head that I can actually speak out and me talking and being social can help me with anything that's coming out of my head and bring it forward, um and it keeps me connected with them, because um obviously we're communicating, so we have that connectedness of, you know, responses to each other, um yeah, that's how I see it. So, I do have a big friendship group, so there is a lot of us, so it's like more of a, a meeting than just hanging out, you know what I mean? So it's, it's like that, yeah.

And how does that make you feel when you're with your friends?

Oh, it's amazing, it's the best feeling, um, yeah, yeah, it's great, I feel like I have a good friendship group, so I'm very, I get very excited to go and, you know, hang out with them the chances that I can, yeah.

Okay, that sounds good and so tell me about when you say, you get, you get excited to see them, can you tell me about that?

Hmm, I think because yeah again because we're all just quite busy, so when we all plan to me up we get to just take pride of that moment, yeah, because, you know, sometimes you're stressed out with work and stuff like that, so you just want to kind of, you know, release all that negative energy out, before you, before you hang out with your friends and just enjoy the fun times you have with them, you know, we'll do, I'd say maybe when you'll be at a friend's house and someone would just be like 'Oh, let's just go to the club', and we'll go together, so it's like we get to really embrace the moment of being together because we know that the next time we'll see each other will be a while where we all get to be together, so, yeah, that's a, it's a very, very nice feeling.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that?

No.

Hmm, can you talk about what you've put in the second box, please?

I'd say, at home it does, can get kind of lonely because, again, everyone's just working, so it gets really difficult to see different family members when you're more, when you're more available, um and again, when you don't have the time to see all of your family members and speak about what's on your mind you don't get to, you only get to voice what you have in your head to yourself, so, um, again, just there's thoughts in your head, it's just like speaking to yourself, so you get that lonely feeling because you have only one person to talk to, which is yourself, so... um yeah just, well that's just for me anyways, it's just, it does kind of get lonely, but... yeah, because I feel like, as well, home is where you have more time to think about different things, so, again, if I'm thinking about different things, whilst I'm by myself then um yeah, it's lonely, it's lonely, it gets lonely.

So, this thinking about something makes you feel lonely?

Yeah, well if it's something that's not very positive, yeah, or even maybe some things that I'm excited to share, but I just don't feel like I could share it, because no one's here, but I'm not really somebody who likes to text somebody and say 'I'm doing this, by the way', I kind of like want to voice it to them... face-to-face, because that's a moment that you can't get on social media, so it's like I could wait three weeks to see you, if I want to tell you something quite important, because I want to tell you about how happy I am, I want you to feel happy for me and just enjoy that moment, even if it's only for five seconds, because a text message isn't the same feeling, do you know what I mean? So...

Okay, um *pause* um, okay, is there anything else you want to say about that?

No.

Okay, thank you.
