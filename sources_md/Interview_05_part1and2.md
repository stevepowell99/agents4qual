Part 2 is below

Thank you. Can we start by talking about what you've put in the first?

Yep, so it's um, one person with a sad face and then groups of people, couples of people with happy faces and so, when you're lonely, you're on your own and you're sad and everyone else around you is all together and they're happy. So, it's sort of like, ex-, like the loneliness relating with sadness, I may be jealous here because everyone else is happy. Yeah. Should I go to the second box?

No, no, I was going to ask you some questions. Um, so you're saying that loneliness is associated with, you know, being on your own, whilst everyone else is happy and you might be feeling jealous, for example, and things like that.

Yeah.

Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel?

Alone, maybe, like no one cares… probably, just generally unhappy.

Um, when you said jealousy, can you tell me more about that?

Mmh, so maybe because the person's alone and they see everyone else and they want to be like them, but they're not, and they don't know how to be, so then they get a bit jealous of them because they're not sure how to be like them.

Mmh, um… okay. Just trying to think, um, so you're saying that, you know, those people may not care about that person in the middle.

They probably do, but the person in the middle, because they’re experiencing loneliness, they feel like they don't, but the other people probably do.

Can you tell me more about that person in the middle, thinking that everyone else doesn't care about them.

Mmh, so, because they're lonely, obviously, it looks like everybody else is sort of forgetting about them, but it's just the person thinking that because the person's lonely, everybody else isn't actually, probably doing that to them, they just feel like that themselves.

Mmh, so they're experiencing loneliness, um what, are you saying that their experience of loneliness is in, like, they're not actually lonely or…

No, they probably are lonely, but not as lonely as they feel like, but it feels a lot worse when you experience loneliness, the person actually experiencing it, and the way other people view it.

Mmh, okay. Do you want to say anything else?

No.

Okay, you can move on to…

Yeah, um, the second one, I just put an empty box because, I don't, it’s sort of loneliness projecting on emptiness really. People that are lonely, there's like nothing around them, sort of thing, they're now just sort of associated with being in an empty space, like in lots of room.

Okay, tell me more about that emptiness.

Um, I'm not really too sure what to say. Maybe it feels like things are average, like maybe they're stuck in that emptiness and the good things are outside of that emptiness, sort of thing. Like excluded, isolated, sort of thing, yeah.

Tell me more about the isolation.

So, like they're on their own, away from everything, sort of something that you do yourself when your lonely, like you don't really involve other people in it, so you’re sort of just surrounded by nothing.

When you said that they um, there are good things outside.

Mmh.

What would be those good things?

Like outside of the loneliness, like things to do that you can only do with your friends or people that you’re obviously friendly with, when you're lonely you can't participate in certain things.

Mmh, and how does that make you feel?

Um again, I think it probably make you feel sad, maybe it will cause you to isolate yourself even more, because you're lonely.

Is there anything else you want to add? So, you're basically saying that this emptiness, empty box, represents, you know, sort of feeling empty on the inside…

Yeah.

…and that is associated with loneliness.

Yeah.

Um… and what might be like some causes to feeling emptiness?

What, like what could cause you to be lonely and then feel like that?

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe having an argument with your friends, or a breakup or maybe someone dying, if you're close to someone and you don't have anyone else, you might feel like everyone else doesn't really understand, like if you don't have close family, you can't tell friends about it because they won't understand, maybe even a pet dying, or if you get a really bad grade and everyone else does well, that could probably make you feel lonely and empty, yeah.

Okay, thank you.

That's all right.

Do you wanna? Um, are you okay to move to the next one?

Yeah, so…

You can start talking about it.

In third one, I wrote bad things or unhealthy things and I drew some alcohol, a cigarette, and that's a chocolate bar *laughs*, yeah, when people are lonely they probably go more towards bad things in life, because, obviously, they can't experience the good things because they're on their own, so they'll do things like drink maybe to forget about it or smoking, just because they're frustrated, or eating a chocolate, like comfort eating because they feel alone.

And um… so alcohol, chocolate and drugs or smoke or cigarette, um sort of make you more lonely in a way or…

No, they’re probably like more to cope with your loneliness, to make you feel less alone, because you feel like you have these things to sort of depend on and like obviously when you're drunk and things like that, you're not really thinking about things like being lonely and if your friends left or someone died, you won't be thinking about it because you'd be drunk, so you sort of take that to get rid of your loneliness. Yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Um, at the time, it probably would be good, it would make you feel good for a while, but then obviously once that all wears off and you go back to being lonely probably feel worse than you did in the beginning.

So, drinking alcohol, cigarettes and chocolate can, can be used as a coping mechanism in a way.

Yeah.

Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

No.

Okay.

And, and the fourth one I drew some rain and wrote ‘cold’, because I sort of just associated with it, with rain and bad weather and like when bad things happen in movies and it's raining outside sort of thing.  Yeah, it's more like *inaudible* but people who are alone don't feel like warm inside sort of thing, they feel cold. Yeah.

Tell me more about that. So, people are, you know, feeling cold like if the weather is cold and if they come home, they feel cold.

Yeah, like when you come home from work, and it's raining outside and it puts like a sort of bad mood on things people are lonely, feel like that all the time, sort of thing. So, if you're alone, then it's sort of like cold and wet and then not, not a nice place.

So, you know, having a low sense of mood is associated with loneliness.

Yeah.

Tell me more about that.

So, when you’re low, and you're lonely, then you sort of go down, like your mood lowers the more lonely you are, sort of thing.

How does that sort of make, make you feel?

Um probably make you feel a bit helpless. Like there's nothing you can really do about it, like when it's raining outside people don't like to do things, do they? So, when you're alone, probably you don’t want to do things either.

How does the weather affect you?

I also don’t like the rain either. It sort of makes you want to like stay indoors and not do anything, *laughs* like not get your work done.

So, when it's lonely, when it's raining, and you're probably not in the mood to kinda do your work and…

No.

Okay. Tell me more about when it's, when, when you're home and it's raining, what, what would be the things that you would want to do?

Um, watch TV, get a blanket, a hot cup of tea, eating again, probably, because you can't go out. So, you just sit indoors and eat and watch TV all day.

Mmh, okay. Thank you. Tell me more about this one, um… how does that and so yeah, can you tell me a little more about that one?

Yeah, so, um it's more, I think like the jealousy and envy’s idea. So, being alone causes you to obviously be envious and be jealous of others. Everyone's lives probably look a lot more better when you're feeling lonely, because you obviously only see what people want and if they’re not feeling the same way as you are, then obviously, they're not staying in the house, they're going out, they’re doing things and you're watching them thinking that, they're like sort of living a better life and you want that too and obviously, you're just up on your own.

So seeing someone sort of living a better life, does that, and, that can make you feel jealous?

Yeah like if you're alone and they’re with people doing things that you can't do, because you don't have anyone like that to do them with then you'd probably be jealous of them.

Um… and  um… okay. And where do you normally see them?

Um… you could see them on social media, that's where you’d see them because obviously you’re in your house, you're not actually seeing them, so you’re just seeing what they show you, like on social media.

So, social media can make you feel inadequate sometimes or...

Yeah, definitely.

Mmh, can you tell me more about that?

Yes. So if you're at home, and all of your friends have maybe gone out all day and you're watching the Snapchats, you're gonna sort of feel alone, because you're not included, you're not in like the group, you're not where they are and you're sort of watching it and it's making you feel more alone because you're seeing them all enjoying time together and doing things that you're not.

So, seeing someone, seeing your friends together and, and, and you here for example, and you're not included there that can make you feel kinda lonely.

Yeah.

Okay, um can you tell me more about this one?

Yeah, so just that when people are lonely it makes them sort of choose bad things, because they're the only things available to them, maybe they see others doing it in their friendship groups and want to be like them and do it on their own but, obviously, that's not a good thing to do on your own. If you're alone, or maybe you're doing it to fit in, so you might not actually want to smoke, you’re just smoking because the people around you are and you don't want to feel lonely, so you do that.

Tell me more about that, so fitting in, so you're doing it to kind of, not like, to kind of go ahead with…

Yeah, like not to be the black sheep sort of thing, like you don't want people to look at you weird because you're not doing the same things as them, people don't really like to be different, so if everyone's sort of doing something, then most people just go along with the crowd because it's what everyone's doing.

And how does that make you feel?

Um… a bit like you have like no sort of self, like, maybe like low self-image, maybe you feel a bit like a clone because you’re like everyone else, you’d be unhappy that you can't do the things that you actually want to do and have to do things that everyone else is doing. Yeah.

So, you're saying that fitting in can help with not feeling lonely?

Yeah, because obviously if you try to be like everyone else and be the same as them, then you're more likely to have friends because people want to be friends with people that are similar to them, not people that aren't doing the same things as them or enjoy doing the same things as them because if your friend doesn't drink and you're going out clubbing, then your friend can't come because your friend doesn't do it, so your friend won't enjoy it and then obviously your friend will be alone.

So, having something in common can prevent loneliness?

Yeah.

And not having something in common can result in…

Yeah, can cause it.

… feeling lonely. Um, okay, can you tell me a little more about this one?

Yes, so that's sort of just away from everything, like there's nothing really there, maybe when you're alone you don't really have goals to do things, maybe you feel like you're stuck in the loneliness forever and there's not really a way out of it.

How does that make you feel?

Maybe trapped, because you can't get out of it.

So, feeling like you don't have any goals can make you feel lonely or knowing that you don’t have any goals to strive for…

Yeah

… can make you feel lonely. Tell me more about that.

Sort of make you feel like you're always going to be stuck in the same place, if you don't have your goals and then obviously everyone will keep progressing past you and you're still sort of stuck, not doing the things that you maybe once wanted to do because your goals have gone, so then you just become lonely, because you have nothing to sort of focus on, so, yeah.

So, feeling behind can, can make you feel on, or falling behind can make you feel lonely.

Yeah.

Tell me more about that.

Because that is the same with the chocolate thing, really, you're not doing the same things as everyone else, like you're not on the same level, maybe, as all your friends are so if everyone’s having goals and going places and doing things and you're sort of not reaching your goals or don't have your goals anymore, then you'll feel quite alone, you feel like no one's really the same as you, so don't really understand you, maybe.

And how does that make you feel trapped?

Because you're sort of stuck and you're watching these people that are doing what they're doing, like reaching their goals and stuff and because you don't have any, you have no like footstep, you have no place to start, so, you're like trapped in that same place that you're in.

So, not being able to progress and seeing others progress can make you feel jealous or lonely and things.

Yeah.

Okay. Is there anything you'd like to say?

No.

It seems that, you're saying that being jealous, feeling or being jealous is associated with loneliness.

Yeah.

Um… okay.

Like maybe if you're lonely, then you'll feel like it's everyone else's fault, that you’re like that, so you'll be jealous of them for doing the things, like maybe them people aren't inviting that person out with them, so they sort of get a bit jealous and it might like be of other things sort of thing, if you’re lonely then you can be jealous of anything else.

Tell me more about when you said that um, you might not have been invited to somewhere.

So yeah, if you're not invited places then you would feel alone, you're not there, you haven’t had sort of the invitation, so, you feel like maybe you don't have any friends or you maybe start thinking that people don't like you, maybe yeah, maybe you think like there’s something wrong with you, if you're not invited and you feel alone, maybe you start thinking you're weird, so then you distance yourself even more and then become more alone.

You, you mentioned that you might think that it's other people's faults that you're lonely, can you tell me more about that?

When you're alone, you obviously don't really have anyone else to speak to, so maybe like you have irrational thoughts because there's no one there to, to sort of tell you that ‘that's not right’, like I guess the longer it goes on for, the longer you're alone, then the deeper you are sort of thing in like your own mind so you probably start thinking things that aren't true.

So, like can you tell me more about um the things that you might think that would be untrue?

Yep, maybe you think that they're doing it on purpose, like maybe you think your friends have plans to go out without you on purpose. Yeah, like that they don't like you and hate you, that maybe you think there's something wrong with you, when really like the other people aren't thinking that and like they didn't, if they went to the cinema like they wouldn't have gone to the cinema on purpose, they obviously just wanted to go to the cinema, yeah.

Thank you. Tell me more about this, um okay, tell me more and then I'll ask you a question.

Mmh. Um, so the cold it could be like also feeling inside, maybe when you're lonely you go cold to other people, like if you've been alone for a long time and then people start trying to get close to you, you’d probably be cold to them because you're used to your loneliness now, so you probably would yeah be cold to other people, like be horrible, be a bit heartless.

Because you ment-, before you mentioned that, you know, when it's cold and raining outside, you come in and you don't want to do work, you want to just watch TV and things.

Yeah.

Tell me more about watching TV. Does that, okay, um can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, it would sort of take the focus away from outside, so, obviously, if you're watching TV, then you don't actually have to see what's going on in the real world, you watch what of like a fantasy sort of thing, so sort of like a distraction from what's going on around you?

Can you tell me more about when you said what's going on around you, tell me more about that.

Yeah, so, if it's raining outside and you focus on the TV, then you're not looking at the weather, if you are alone and you’re watching the TV, then you're not thinking about your friends, that are at the cinema or wherever they are without you, because you sort of got something else to fix on.

And how does that make you feel watching the Telly?

Um, good, would make you feel happy maybe, you’d be laughing, so you're being in a better mood, make you feel less lonely, maybe you could relate to the people on the TV more than you could to the ones that are actually outside, but maybe that's because they're not real.

Tell me more about that.

So, like it depends on what sort of TV you watch, obviously Reality TV wouldn't make you feel the same as if you watched an actual movie that’s about five people because the Reality TV is obviously people that are sort of like the main basis of what everyone else does and people in films aren't usually like everyone else because they're quite like focused on one thing whereas Reality TV everyone's the same as everyone in real life. Yeah.

Okay, thank you. Is there anything else you want to add about any of them?

No.

Okay, thank you.

That's okay.

Thank you. Can we start by talking about what you’ve put first, please?

Yes, so in the box for place you feel most socially connected, I’ve put the local shop because that's somewhere where obviously there's friendly like familiar shopkeeper and you bump into people from the neighbourhood, so you're sort of well-connected maybe even people that you haven't seen in a while, you'll bump into them there, so it's sort of like a social connection.

Okay. Um… so you like the idea of seeing familiar faces?

Yeah, it could even be on the street doesn't necessarily have to be a place sort of thing, maybe just walk around and seeing people that you know.

Mmh, tell me more about this local shop.

So, the local shop is obviously that one out there, um the shopkeeper has been there for ages since I was probably… a baby, so if someone that they're not like a family friend and they're not your family, but someone that you're familiar, with even though you're not… like related or you're not like that sort of close to, but it's just a familiar face, like a friendly person, maybe don't talk to them all the time, but someone nice sort of thing, like when you go into shops and the shopkeeper’s rude and you don't really know them, that sometimes, things like that can affect your day, that maybe it will put you in a bad mood, so having that is always good because it keeps you in a good mood.

So, you’re saying like someone, if you’ve had a bad day for example and seeing for example that shopkee, shopkeeper, that makes you feel good, it puts you in a good mood, you're saying?

Yeah, if you have a bad day, and then you walk into local shop, and it's friendly and it's asking you ‘are you okay?’ Like ‘what's been happening’ like and catching up with people then it will probably put you in a better mood.

Okay. And, um, anyway is it just the shopkeeper, like tell me more about other people in the shop that you might, yeah.

Yeah, so because it's the local shop, like you can even bump into your friends in there and like find out about things you didn't know before, so like I went into the shop and I see my friends and they were having a barbeque and then they invited me and then yeah, I went straight there, so sort of like connections: it takes you to other places as well, if you bump into people that you know, sort of thing.  It's nice to like be somewhere, seeing people that you know anyway, because it makes you feel like comfortable.

Thank you. There's anything else you want to say about that?

No.

Okay, whenever you feel comfortable going to box two…

Yes, so, the place I feel most lonely I’ve put the hospital, so a normal, general hospital, because that's quite like an alone place, nobody speaks to each other, obviously everybody's sort of on their own and the workers are stressed out and unfriendly so that would make you feel alone because maybe you're not being given the right sort of approach that you should be, there, so you don't, you feel like alone with everyone.

Mmh, so you’re saying that unfriendliness um, is what sort of, can predict feeling lonely.

Yeah, if people are unfriendly then you'd feel more alone than if people was friendly.

Tell me more about the atmosphere there, when you say that no one’s speaking to each other.

So like, people that obviously are like together, the person that you've gone with, you'll speak to, but everyone else like you're all sort of on your own, even if you're in your group, you’re on your own, it's not like a community sort of thing, it's more of just people that live in the same place, go into the same place because that's obviously in the neighbourhood, it's not like people talking and socialising with each other, everyone just sort of stays separate.

It seems like, you're saying that the lack of social-, of socialization in there contributes to feeling lonely.

Yeah.

Okay.

If you sit in a waiting room for like hours without speaking to people, then you’d start feeling alone and probably a bit depressed because you haven't had that social connection, I feel like you sort of need that to like boost energy and keep going, sort of thing, yeah.

Tell me more about the workers being stressed.

So like, because it's obviously quite overpopulated, the workers, maybe they've had long shifts, maybe they're feeling like a bit exhausted, they're stressed out, they’re trying to rush into things, like they've got too many things to do, so, also you have to wait a long time to be seen, obviously, no one speaks for a long time, then you're feeling lonely. So, it's sort of like the workers being overworked as well, if they’re stressed maybe they're not as friendly to you, maybe not as helpful either, like if you're asking them how long you're waiting to be seen that's not on top on their list to do.

So not being heard or not being sort of attended, attended to…

Yeah

Can make you feel lonely.

Yeah.

Tell me more about that.

So like, if no one’s sort of paying attention to what you sort of need, then you feel like you're alone, you think that they don't care about your needs or.

And how does that make you feel?

It would make you feel a bit upset, you'd feel quite distressed, if you're waiting for a long time and you're asking people and they're not helping, then you’d start probably feeling a bit distressed.

Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

Nah, that's it.

Okay, thank you.
