Interview 34 – Male, 23, Tower Hamlets

Interviewer:

OK, so can we start by talking about what you’ve put first?

Interviewee:

First, basically, um, when I’m always lonely, I feel loneliness, I feel like crying but you know, I don’t cry. I feel like staying at home and…that’s it, but I feel very sad when I’m alone. I don’t find no one to go out, no one’s there for me. That’s why. I feel like crying, nothing to do. But sometimes I feel like doing something big. Like doing something like showing the whole world I’m something…that everyone has to me know me. Something like this but you know most of the time I feel like crying but I don’t even cry, but I’m sad. I’m on the phone, listening to music, that’s it. That’s how I pass my time when I’m alone. [Pause]. Yeaah, I feel like want to go somewhere outside and but there’s no one there to take me outside but I feel like I can find someone to go outside but no one comes over there. Or sometimes I go to my cousin’s house when I’m alone yeah that’s it. And every time I feel lonely I start learning something new, when I’m alone. I learn something, something new about technology or anything new about business, um, just like I told you before, Amazon FBA - it’s a drop shipping business, when I’m alone I feel like making more and more money so I can enjoy my life. And then, when I’m alone…

Interviewer:

Sorry, by the way, are we, we’re just doing this one first [referring to box 1], and then we do this one and then this one and then this one [referring to the other boxes]. Did you already go through or?

Interviewee:

I mixed it already.

Interviewer:

Don’t worry about it. We can just, we’ll start with the first box and then I’ll tell you when we can move on to the second one. Is that OK?

Interviewee:

OK, that’s fine.

Interviewer:

So, with the first one, you mentioned that you know you feel like crying but you don’t cry and you feel like you’re sad. Can you tell me more about that, when you say you feel sad, tell me more.

Interviewee:

Yeah, I feel like sad, like I don’t want to do anything, like very sad, feel very bored, boring, yeah that’s it. I feel boring. Yeah, that’s all.

Interviewer:

When you say bored, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Bored meaning like got nothing to do, feel nothing, don’t feel like eating, and don’t feel like going outside, always feel like sleeping in one place, my bed. That’s it.

Interviewer:

And how does, what kind of things make you feel like that?

Interviewee:

Loneliness.

Interviewer:

And, okay, tell me more.

Interviewee:

Loneliness makes me feel like this. Yeah, just loneliness, it’s a very bad thing, trust me. A loneliness person can suicide, you know that?

Interviewer:

Loneliness what, sorry?

Interviewee:

They can suicide. When they’re alone.

Interviewer:

Oh, they can suicide, commit suicide.

Interviewee:

Yeah. When they’re alone. Yeah. It’s a very bad thing. No one can stay alone. In this world, everyone has to have someone to stay with. You know what I mean. It can be his wife, girlfriend, friend, cousins, family. He needs someone to stay with, trust me. He can never stay alone. If you’re alone, you have to do at least something, you can’t sit around like you’re gonna feel like shit, there’s nothing in this life, there’s nothing, so you have to do something, when you’re alone. You can’t stay at home lonely, you have to do at least something – talk on the phone with friends, family, at least, something else, you know what I mean. That’s what I do when I’m alone, yeah.

Interviewer:

And when you say that ‘in this world, people shouldn’t be alone’. Tell me more.

interviewee:

Basically, in this world, it’s a world, innit? In this world, people have to be with someone, so generally, everyone is with someone, so that’s what I mean.

Interviewer:

So, when you say like ‘in this world’, are you referring to anything specific about this world that leads to people feeling lonely or?

Interviewee:

Specifically, no, I’m not saying anything specifically.

Interviewer:

And um, and when you say you feel like crying, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

I feel like crying, it comes from my heart, feel like crying, I don’t even cry, but I feel like crying. But tears don’t come out. Yea, that’s how I feel.

Interviewer:

And how does that make you feel when you say you’re alone, and sad and you don’t have things to do, you feel bored, you feel like crying. How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

It makes me feel sad. It makes me feel sad. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And what are the things that make you feel lonely?

Interviewee:

What are the things that make me feel lonely? When I’m doing something alone. That’s when I feel lonely. And when I’m going somewhere out but no one’s with me, that’s when I feel lonely. When I go shopping and I have no one to come with me that when I feel lonely. That’s how I feel lonely.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like what you’re saying is whether you’re at home alone or whether you’re out – because you’re alone, you don’t have a company with you, that’s when you feel lonely.

Interviewee:

Yea, it’s perfect. Yeah. That’s how I feel lonely. Just because, now you’re with me, I’m not lonely, I can talk to you, you’re doing my interview, I’m not alone, I feel very good, I feel nice.

Interviewer:

And what else did you write here? “I feel like crying most of the time”.

Interviewee:

Most of the time I feel like crying, but I don’t cry.

Interviewer:

[reading the description on the participant’s paper] “But I don’t cry at all”.

Interviewee:

I don’t even cry, tears don’t come out.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you keep your emotions inside.

Interviewee:

Emotions inside. It’s perfect. Yeah. I keep my emotions inside. I don’t tell anyone nothing. Just because you’re doing my interview, that’s why I’m telling yo, but I don’t tell anyone nothing.

Interviewer:

And, how do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

Um, I wished I could tell someone I feel, but there’s no one to tell, isn’t it?

There’s no one to tell. That’s why. I don’t tell anyone.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you actually want to express how you feel to someone…

Interviewee:

[continues the previous sentence] But…. yeah. I feel like telling someone but in my mind, I feel shy to tell someone, what they’re going to think of me, that’s why I don’t tell anyone nothing.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you want to express how you feel to someone but at the same time you worry that they may judge you.

Interviewee:

Yeah, they might judge me, yeah.

Interviewer:

How do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

Um, I feel very bad, very bad about that. [long pause].

Interviewer:

And what does this face represent? [referring to the drawing]

Interviewee:

It represents sadness.

Interviewer:

Tell me, what thoughts do normally go through you head, when you’re in that situation feeling sad?

Interviewee:

Um, basically, there’s too many thoughts come to my head. When I’m alone I feel like doing a big business but I wished like, I don’t have money, how am I gonna do a business. That’s all that the thoughts come to my mind, I feel like going somewhere outside, in my imagination I feel like I’m in Maldives, Mauritius, enjoying over there. That’s what I feel.

Interviewer:

When you say that when you feel sad, you think about doing business.

Interviewee:

Yeah, doing business, yeah. No, basically, when I’m alone, sometimes it comes to my mind, like doing something big, doing business, like I feel like there’s a shop over there, there’s a restaurant over there, I feel like doing something big, but I don’t have money, where I get the money from? There’s too many thoughts come to my mind, too many thoughts.

Interviewer:

And are the thoughts in relation to doing a business only?

Interviewee:

Um, yea, doing a business, travelling somewhere, there’s too many thoughts come. Too many thoughts. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And how do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah sometimes I feel you know, when something good thoughts come I feel good but when something bad comes, basically a loneliness is a depression, you know what I mean? It’s a depression. If you’re alone too many times, like every single day for a month, you’re gonna feel, you’re gonna get into depression. That’s how sometimes it happens. Sometimes, trust me man, there’s too many things. Sometimes I feel like I’ll go somewhere and I’m gonna kill that person. Sometimes I’m angry as hell, trust me I’m angry, when I’m alone, I’m angry, I feel like drinking, I feel like doing something bad, going somewhere outside: club, pub. That’s how I feel.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like when you’re feeling sad and alone, you want to go out and do something different.

Interviewee:

Something different, yeah.

Interviewer:

Sometimes.

Interviewee:

Yea, that’s it.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee:

Um, about this box [referring to box 1]?

Interviewer:

Yea.

Interviewee:

No, that’s it.

Interviewer:

Okay, thank you. Can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the next box please?

Interviewee:

It’s all about the sadness, loneliness. Yeah, that’s it. It’s basically related to one another. Something like this. It’s related to this this one this one [referring to the boxes on the sheet].

Interviewer:

So, is it okay if we read it? Can you read it?

Yeah, “I feel very sad when I’m lonely, just want to go somewhere out, there’s no one that I can go out with”.

Interviewer:

You want to go somewhere did you say?

Interviewee:

Yes, somewhere. But there’s no one.

[continues the sentence] That I can go out with. Yeah, I feel like, yeah, there’s no one, no one means like there’s no one, everyone’s busy, but I’m only free but have no one to go out, no family members, no friends, and you know any relatives, cousins, one one’s there to take me outside, but I got my own, outside, go outside, do something, smoke outside. Yeah, something like this.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like, um, you want to go out but you feel like you don’t have many people to go out with.

Interviewee:

Yeah, I feel very sad when I’m lonely, but I just want to go out but there’s no one that I can go out with, I have to go by my own. Yeahhh. A loneliness is depression, man. Trust me. When I’m alone, I don’t want to live in this world. When I’m alone, that’s how I feel. Trust me. Ask someone else, they’re gonna say the same like this. I hope so. And no one can live alone, yeah, no one. [pause].

Interviewer:

And how does it make you feel when you want to go out but you don’t have people to go out with?

Interviewee:

That makes me feel sad, sometimes, it makes me feel very angry when they need me I’m always there for me them but when I need them no one doesn’t help me. No one doesn’t come out. Just when I’m angry and basically, I tell them that next time I’m not gonna be with you guys. They say: “Okay, it’s fine”. That makes me more emotions, more angry, I feel like more crying. Yea, that’s it. That’s why I feel very bad.

Interviewer:

So, what you’re saying is when people need you, you’re available for them but when you need to go out…

Interviewee:

[continues the conversation] Yeah, no one is available for me, that’s when I feel very bad, very sad, very lonely. That makes me feel cry, but you know, I can’t cry innit? I’m not a baby anymore.

Interviewer:

And, um, yea, so, it sounds like what you’re saying is you make efforts for your friends but you don’t feel that your needs are met from them.

Interviewee:

Yea, but, I make efforts for them, they don’t make efforts for me. They don’t do anything for me. When I need them they don’t even come. When they need me, they shout at me - why don’t you come out, what you doing? You don’t even come, you’re not my friend anymore. That’s what they tell me.

Interviewer:

And, how does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

That makes me feel…. feel like...everyone is...um, everyone is selfish, everyone is very selfish, that feels like selfish people, yeah, so.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘selfish’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Selfish, basically – they think only for themselves, and not for someone else. They think only for themselves. That’s what called a selfish. A selfish doesn’t think about anyone, no one, not even their family, no friends, no one. If they’re alone, they’re not bothered about this.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘when they’re alone, they’re not bothered by it’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Basically, they don’t even care about this. When I’m alone, they don’t even care. When I feel bad, they don’t even care. They don’t say nothing, they don’t even come out, they say ‘it’s okay, don’t worry man, I’m busy at this moment, I can’t come out’. That’s how I feel bad, it’s when I feel very bad.

Interviewer:

It sounds like what you’re saying is, it seems like when you feel sad and down your friends don’t care about you?

Interviewee:

Yeah, they don’t care about me. That’s when I feel very lonely, very alone, I don’t feel like doing anything but you know I have to go next day to my work, that’s why I stay at home doing nothing.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee:

Um, I don’t have anything else to say about this box.

Interviewer:

Thank you. Can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the third box please?

3rd box

Interviewee:

Every time I feel lonely, I start learning something new. Basically, I’ve got books, self-improvement books, sometimes I read the books to learn something new, new about people, new about technology, new about everything, everything, you know…being in this world, everything, basically. I got a book called ‘think and grow rich’ by Napolian Hill. Have you read it?

Interviewer:

No

Interviewee:

Um, too many people like, basically, I searched Google, over 80% of the people in this world, they’re a millionaire by reading this book. Trust me, there’s something, yeah. That’s when I feel lonely, I read some self-improvement books, another book called ‘Rich dad and poor dad”. I read that book. There’s a book called ‘The Secret’. Have you read this book?

Interviewer:

Yeah.

Interviewee:

The Secret? Have you? Truuust me, the book, man. It’s a book. It’s a law of attraction. Why you think always you attract that thing? I just love this book man, trust me. It’s true – what you speak all the time, you attract that thing all the time. Yeah. I’m on this topic. So, when I feel alone, I read the self-improvement books, I go on YouTube, I learn something new. When I’m alone, I don’t want to make my, you know, I don’t want to be alone. When I feel lonely, I don’t want to be lonely, that’s why I do different things like go to YouTube, I watch some grand academy video, you know, grand academy, you know, from America, yeah, I watch these videos, motivational videos, so it motivates me, I go to YouTube and search like ‘I’m lonely so motivate me’. Some motivational videos, it comes up then I watch them, I feel good. Yeah. Sometimes, yeah, I learn something new. That’s how I reduce like, my loneliness. Yeah, that’s it. [pause] that’s all about this box.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like when you feel lonely, you turn into some sort of information inducing platform.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

Reading books or watching something on YouTube, on the internet.

Interviewee:

Yea, that’s it.

Interviewer:

And, um, when you say you read books, um, tell me more about that since specifically you said you read books those self-help books.

Self-improvement books. Yeah, basically, when you go to college or university, they don’t tell you about your self-improvements, how to improve yourself and all the stuff, they just got the text book, read this book, give answers, all the stuff, but most universities, like Harvard university, big, big university, they’re very good but some universities they don’t tell you about this – about self-improvement things. Schools doesn’t teach you about self-improvement things. Only, self-improvement books can help you out. That’s why I read some self-improvement books.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like what you’re saying is when you feel lonely, you want to

[continues the sentences], learn something.

Interviewer:

Learn something new. You want to find ways to improve yourself.

Interviewee:

Ways to improve myself. When I feel lonely, I, that’s when I find the time and you know, to learn something new, that’s why I learn something new. Yeah. You know, I’m gonna do something like go find a website to buy a amazon FBA course, that’s what I’m gonna buy. Whenever I feel alone, I’m gonna learn about Amazon FBA, so I can’t be alone. I’m not gonna give myself to stay alone. Yeah, that’s it. I’m going to get the course, and I’m going learn and then I can make money: buy cars, a house, travel the world, that’s it.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel when you feel lonely and you go onto, when you learn something new.

Interviewee:

That feels nice when I learn something new but when I feel very bored, at the second box, I saw, I don’t want to do something, I feel like crying, but you know, I don’t cry. I feel very bad when I’m alone, depression comes to me. That’s when I do, sometimes I do, it’s in the fourth box, I’m going to say it. Sometimes I feel like doing meditation. You know meditation is? It helps me very, you know, it is very helpful, when I’m alone I do meditation, breathing better. Yea, it’s very good, it helps. Trust me it helps. But I feel very bad when I’m alone that’s all.

Interviewer:

Um, When you say that you um, you basically want to learn these courses like Amazon to be able to make money, buy nice cars or travel. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Basically, I have a dream and my dream is to do business. So, that’s why I got a chance to do with amazon fba. Most of the people they’re doing it, that’s why I want to get into it. My dream is to be like a big business man, trust me. A big, very big business man. I just want to do rule a big company. In my mind, I already made everything thoughts:  how to do it, what to do, what the brand going to be, I already done in my mind. But I hope so one day I’ll make it successful. One day. Yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully. If I can work very hard. Hopefully. One day. Day one or day two, one day. But I’ll never lose hope. Yeah.

Interviewer:

You also mentioned that when you feel lonely you go onto the internet and search for motivational videos that combat loneliness; you said you search for “I’m lonely, motivate me”. Can you, this is what you type on YouTube, right?

Interviewee:

Yeah yeah, that’s what I type. And Some motivational video comes up like last night I had a sound, motivational sound – it’s very good, trust me. It’s nothing, they don’t say nothing, it’s just the sound. What we say, it’s just the tune. It makes you feel very good, makes you feel strong, trust me. You can go and search and find some sound like this. It’s not a track, they don’t tell you nothing, they don’t say nothing, you just need to hear the sound. That’s it. That’s when you feel very good, very strong, you feel motivate, you don’t feel lonely, you feel like doing something more, more good things, it’s like what do you call it? Submiliner [can’t figure out this word] or something. I don’t understand what it is. Yeah, that’s what I do.

Interviewer:

And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

That makes me feel good when I listen to the track. That makes me very good – feels very good. Yeah.

Interviewer:

So, um, can we read this, can you read this for me? [referring to the writing on the box]

Interviewee:

Um, every time I feel like lonely, I start learning something new about technology, technologies now days people’s everyday

Interviewer:

[interrupts because there was a loud sound of ambulance] You know what, I think, because we’re recording this, can you just repeat that again? [just to make sure the participant’s voice was heard in the recording].

Interviewee:

Um, every time I feel lonely, I start to learn something new about technology, you know, I told you about, you know, Amazon FBA, it’s a technology thing that technology is now days people’s everyday need that’s why I learn technology. Basically, 80% of Americans buying from Amazon, it’s a technology, everyone’s, nowadays everyone’s buying from internet, so the internet nowadays ruling the world, you can say, but it’s not good to say. Yeah, it’s about technology, innit? When I’m alone, I start learning, that’s it. I start learning. Learning, the more you learn, the more you earn. If you learn more, that’s when you earn more. That’s what someone said, I forgot his name. A big man. Yeah.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you’re motivated by money.

Interviewee:

Trust me, I’m motivated by money. Yeah. Motivated by money and yeah. Business as well. You know what, guess what. You know Ali Express?

Interviewer:

No.

Interviewee:

Um, it’s a child, it’s a website in China. Ali Express, most people know about that. I bought ring for one £1, a ring I bought for £1. I sold that ring to my friend for £40. Trust me. It looks very, it’s not original, I told him that it’s not even original, but it’s nice. You can buy it. I just told him that I got, I got this from Dubai if you want to buy it, up to you. £40. He just said, yeah, come give it to me. I made £39 profit straight away. Trust me. But, after some weeks the colour went down and everything, he was like, “you bumped me mate, look what happened to my ring?” I was like: “I told you before, mate.” Yeah, I’m motivated by business, money, yeah.

Interviewer:

And when you say you’re motivated by money and business; can you tell me how that could impact your loneliness.

Interviewee:

Um, basically, I’m doing something. When I’m doing a business, when I’m doing a work, that’s when I’m doing something, when you do something you don’t feel alone, you don’t lonely. When you’re not doing something, you sit in one place, that’s when you feel lonely. Now, I’m doing something with you, you’re doing my interview. I’m giving, I’m telling something to you, so that’s, I’m doing something, now I’m not feeling lonely. I’m with you, I’m talking, I’m not lonely. But when I’m not doing something, I’m alone at home, somewhere outside I’m alone, I’m not doing something, I’m bored, I’m sitting like this, I’m not doing something, I’m smoking, I’m drinking, that’s not you’re doing something, that’s when you’re alone it makes you smoke, it makes you drink. But I’m doing something good, I’m not alone.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box?

Interviewee:

Uuuuum, I don’t.

Interviewer:

Okay, can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the fourth box.

interviewee:

Fourth box.

Interviewer:

I know you said ‘meditation’ but let’s.

interviewee:

Um, no, I didn’t put ‘meditation’ I think.

Interviewer:

Sorry?

Interviewee:

I didn’t put ‘meditation’ over there?

Interviewer:

Oh, I thought you said in the next box…

interviewee:

Yeaaa. Next box.

Interviewer:

Is that?

Interviewee:

If you just give me one sec, I’ll just put meditation as well.

Interviewer:

Um, if you want. Yeah. And then we can talk about it.

Interviewee:

I forgot to put.

Interviewer:

Yeah.

Interviewee:

Yeahhhh. Hold on a sec.

Yeah, basically, when I’m alone, I feel like crying but, you know, my heart is very strong, I put over there ‘my heart is very strong, as strong as strong’, trust me. My girlfriend left me but I didn’t say nothing to her, I didn’t even give her a text, nothing, cause my heart is strong, that’s why. She didn’t want to stay with me, that’s fine, you know, I let her go, go and it’s your life, you decide your life, let me decide my life, let me do something new. When I’m successful, you’re gonna see me, you’ll see me, yeah. My heart is very strong, I don’t cry, when I feel lonely, I feel like crying, I told you before, but I don’t cry. It’s all about my heart, strong heart, brave heart, it’s not about brave heart, it’s like strong heart. Yeah. And you know, when I’m alone, I do meditation, I take off everything, basically, soft clothes, I stay like this, I do meditation, it makes you feel um, basically, um, we’re doing something, the energy doesn’t go to our brain perfectly, you know what I mean. The energy, not the energy, sorry, the oxygen – it’s not going perfectly. [taking a deep breath] So, when you take deep breath there, the oxygen goes to our, you know, brain and it makes out brain fresh, it’s like nothing the brain is fresh, like it just wakes up from the sleep, that’s it. That’s when I feel lonely, I do meditate myself, I do meditation. But, I feel like going somewhere to the beach and do meditation but there’s not any beach around me or no any mountain or anything. It’s very good to do meditation in the mountain, somewhere in the mountain or in a very quiet place, you have to do meditation in a very quiet place but the mountain, you know, I don’t find any mountain or beach but I wish I lived somewhere near the mountain or any beach so I can do meditation very nicely, you know, it’s, it’s a law of meditation that you do meditation at a quiet place, if you think about anything very good, at this meditation time, you get this, so that’s why you know, Indian people do these things, most of the Indian people do meditation to achieve their goals. When you do meditation, think about your goals, so it comes to your life. It’s a law of attraction, you can say it’s a law of attraction. You read the book already, The Secret, yeah. So, yeah. That’s it. Meditation, innit?  You have to do meditation. When you’re alone, just try once, I’m telling you.  When you’re alone, do meditation and then feel how it feels. It feels very good when you’re lonely, you can do meditation, you know how to do meditation, you can do it. Just try it once, trust me, you feel sooo good, good as good, good as hell, trust me. I swear. It feels sooo good. Yeah, I can tell everyone. Is it recording, yeah? I’m telling everyone, just so, in your class, everyone’s gonna listen to this, right?

Interviewer:

No, no, just me.

interviewee:

Oh, just you?

Interviewer:

Yeah.

Interviewee:

Oh, okay. I would have told everyone that do meditation, read self-improvement books. When you’re alone, just try to do something new. Just try working on the internet, do some surveys on internet, make like at least, if you said 45p, if you said 25p, you’re making something innit? You’re doing something. When you’re alone, um, when you’re not doing something, that’s when you’re lonely. That’s, um, you feel bad, that’s when the depression comes in, yeah. So, I have to do something. When I’m, you know, lonely, I have to do something to, to, reduce the loneliness. What do you call it? To um, yeah, to not feel alone. Have to do something not to feel alone. Have to do something. Yeah.

Interviewer:

Just to reflect back what you said earlier, and um, come back to what you said recently. So basically, you said that um, you [interviewee interrupts].

Interviewee:

So, after everything, basically, when I’m, after everything, when I’m alone I have to do something to reduce my loneliness, I have to do something. When we do something, we’re not alone. That’s how it works.

Interviewer:

So, when, so you do something, so if you feel lonely, you go and do something new and that reduces your loneliness.

Interviewee:

That reduces my loneliness. I have to do something new to reduce my loneliness.

Interviewer:

Even if that means you’re alone doing that?

interviewee:

Um, if I do this alone, if I work something alone, if I learn something alone, that doesn’t make lonely. Until I’m doing something makes me lonely, so basically, I’m doing something it doesn’t make me lonely, if I do something it doesn’t never make me feel lonely. If I go to the gym it doesn’t make me lonely but if I have someone with me it feels good but doesn’t make lonely because there’s too many people over there doing gym, and I can’t tell anyone to help me out, you know. That doesn’t make me lonely.

Interviewer:

Um, when you said you basically have a very strong heart, you know your girlfriend broke up with you, um how did that make you feel?

Interviewee:

First, I was like, you know, I used to talk to her every single day. When I wake up in the morning, I used to find her text ‘good morning’, when I used to go sleep, I used to give her a good night text.

And, yeah, I’m good, now I’m okay without her, I’m fine without her, but first when you know someone left you, you feel very bad but after some moment, you start something, you doing something new, you don’t feel lonely, you don’t feel bad. Yeah. That’s it.

Interviewer:

So, you’re saying that breakups make you feel lonely?

Interviewee:

Break ups, yeah. Break ups make you lonely as well. Break ups as well. If you get someone after the breakup then you’re not lonely anymore. At least, after all, you should have someone with you or you should do something new to reduce the loneliness. That’s it.

I work over there and, I’m basically socially connected with everyone over there, everything and you know, basically, in this shop, from the kid to the old people, you know, oldest people, everyone comes to the shop cause we have everything. That’s how I’m connected with everyone. Some older uncle comes, they speak to me, “hello, you okay?” In my, you know, Bagnoli language, they speak to me, it’s a Bagnoli area, St Paul’s way, it’s 99% people are Bagnoli over there. So, I work over there and I’m socially connected with them. Whenever someone goes to holiday they tell me, they come to the shop and say ‘bye I’m going to on holiday for one week’, you know, that’s how I’m connected with them, I’m connected basically connected with everyone over there, you know, yeah. That’s how I’m socially connected.

So, it sounds like you’re connecting with people of all kinds when you’re at work at the supermarket.

Interviewee:

[speaks at the same time the interviewer speaks] All kinds.

Interviewer: Young…

Interviewee:

From young to old – I’m connected with everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone talks to me. Everyone comes to our shop, when it’s not busy, everyone comes, I talk to them, they talk to me, they buy a drink, you know, they chill for a bit, you know, it’s like it’s a local shop, that’s how it is. Yeah. That’s how I feel very good.

Interviewer:

And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

That makes me feel like chilling all the time. At my work, I don’t feel like I’m working -I’m chilling all the time, chilling, all the time chilling, over there. I’m not working, basically, I serve customers but I’m chilling over there, trust me. I don’t feel like working over there, I’m not working, I feel I’m chilling over there, most of the time I’m chilling, yeah, that’s how it feels very good. I’d love to work over there but you know I’m gonna leave this work very soon, I’m gonna do something new, but it’s been long time I’m working over there. I have to do something new.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you feel very chilled in your current job right now and you’d like...

Interviewee:

[interrupts] I feel very chilled, yeah, very chilled at my currently job cause I’m talking to everyone, I’m connected. When you are connected with everyone in your own area, that’s when you feel very good. When you’re socially connected with everyone in the area, that’s when you feel good, when everyone says ‘hi’, ‘hello’ to you, says ‘what you doing today?’, ‘you okay today?’, ‘how you doing?’, when everyone is talking with you, that’s when you feel very good. Yeah. Yeah, that’s how I feel very good.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee:

Um, basically, I’ll say like, if you want to reduce your loneliness, go to some workplace that everyone chills with you, everyone like you, everyone needs you, yeah, that’s it. That’s it about this box.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘everyone needs you’, can you tell me

Interviewee:

[interrupts] ‘Everyone needs you’, it’s like you have some experience about that work, that’s when everyone needs you. When you have experience about something that’s when someone needs you. When you’re working in one place for long time, the owners of the company, the mangers are gonna need you. That’s what I mean. They need you. Need you means like they want you to work for over there for some more time. That’s what I mean.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say?

Interviewee:

No, that’s it.

Interviewer:

Okay, thank you. Can we talk about, can we start by talking about box 2 please?

Interviewee:

Yea, the place I feel very lonely is at home…in my room, I feel nothing to do innit? That’s when I feel lonely, and most of the time, events, when I go to events and I don’t find any of my friends, no one I don’t know, that’s when I feel lonely. I feel very bad, cause there’s no one to talk with me, that’s when I feel very bad. Yeah, that’s it.

If you want to go to some events or, you know I told you before, when I’m in the gym but if I have a friend with me, it’s good I can talk with I’m and do gym but it’s okay there’s some other people that are over there. It’s like at home, I feel very bored, that’s a best place for the loneliness – in the room, doing nothing, it’s the loneliness inside the room. You’re doing nothing, that’s when you’re alone.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like what you’re saying is you feel lonely at home.

Interviewee:

Yeah, I feel lonely at home. [Pause] Trust me, but I try to, you know, reduce the loneliness but as I told you before, like doing something at least I have to do something to reduce the loneliness. Yeahh, that’s why I do something.

Interviewer:

When you say you feel most lonely at home, can you tell me more about that, at home.

Interviewee:

Basically, um, sorry [because he was stretching for a second].

Interviewer:

It’s okay.

Interviewees

Um, last time you know I, festival of Muslim people, Eid festival, yeah. That’s, I had to work this day as well but I feel good working over there cause I’m chilling over there, but I came home like, 10 o clock at night and there’s no one at home, there’s no one. Everyone was at my cousin’s house. That’s when I felt alone, no one’s there and I was eating by myself, on my own, that’s how I feel alone, cause no one’s over there.

Interviewer:

And you also mentioned you feel lonely in your room. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah, in my room. Basically, cause doing nothing in one place.

Interviewer:

Sorry?

Interviewee:

Basically, in my room, basically, if you’re in one place, you’re gonna feel lonely, you’re gonna feel bored, you’re gonna have nothing to do…in the room, so, yeah I mentioned ‘in the room’, yeah, you now, there’s nothing to do in one place. At least you have to walk around. If it’s, if my room was very good, I would have walked around, I’d have had big massive TV, I’d have liked something to do like playing games but it’s, my room is very small, I can’t put anything in my room, so yeah I’ve got nothing, there’s just a couple of books and a lap top, that’s it. That’s how I pass my time when I feel alone.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

Ahh, that makes me feel very lonely when I’m alone at home. That makes me feel very bad. That feels very bad, yeah.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel when you’re at home, and in your room and you can’t, I should have asked you this actually: how does that make you feel when your room, when you feel that your room is small and you can’t do much in your room?

Interviewee:

I feel like doing something, I feel like having another house, another room having a big room. [Pause]. So, I can do something more, I can get, big you know, games and all those stuff, computer games, big games, I can get games…when I feel alone.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you feel most lonely at home or in your room because you feel bored, you don’t have very many people there.

Interviewee:

No, yeah, that’s how I feel, trust me.

Interviewer:

And, what about your family members?

Interviewee:

When they’re not at home, that’s when I feel very lonely but when they’re at home, that’s okay, I can talk to them, chill with them. That’s it.

Interviewer:

But, generally speaking, you feel most lonely at home, in your room, because you don’t have very many things to do.

Interviewee:

Yeah, very many things to do, that’s true.

Interviewer:

And you find yourself reading something – self-development books, going on the internet.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

And, you also mentioned that your room is small, you can’t really do much in there, which can contribute to your loneliness.

Interviewee:

That’s what I mentioned as well.

Interviewer:

Is there anything you want to say?

Interviewee:

Um, yeah, that’s fine, I can’t even look.

Interviewer:

OK, thank you very much.

Interviewee:

Thanks.
