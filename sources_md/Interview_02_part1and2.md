Interview 2, - Male, 23, Newham - Part 2

P.S This person says they feel at peace in the park and it’s just them and their thoughts. I wonder if young people don’t realise that over thinking may actually be detrimental. While they think being alone in thoughts and engaging in thinking is good for them, it reality it may be bad.

So, can you start by talking about what you’ve put first?

Ok, so the first word here is ‘alone’, I feel like that represent loneliness because is, I can only talk from a personal perspective, I feel like loneliness for me represents um… the best way I can represent it is being secluded from other people, being kind of, the key word is alone. How I would kinda interpret it is more, cause I feel like I’ve experienced loneliness in some way, shape or form, but for me I would say it’s more of a, the best way I’d, I’d explain it is having people to talk to, but not knowing how to talk to the people… so that, that would really kind of conclude what I mean by alone, so having, having people to communicate with but not knowing how to do it leads to kind of loneliness from how, how, that’s kinda the best way, hence why I’ve put ‘alone’ because there’s, there’s always people around but not knowing how to express yourself makes you feel alone, you might not necessarily be alone, but because you can’t express how you feel or express what you wanna get across, it kind of leads to loneliness. That’s how I kinda connect the two words together, but um… yeah, I think ‘alone’ really represents not having, like that loneliness feeling of being alone, or having anyone close to you or having a way of communicating certain things to people, I feel like that’s what really outlines why I’ve put alone. I think the second one is more *gets interrupted*

Before we go into the second one, so you’re saying that you know you might be around people but um, but, but because it’s, because you may not be able to communicate with them, or you may not be able to express yourself that may lead to feelings of -

Feeling of loneliness yeah *continues* so, like I said I can only talk from my own personal experience and being someone that has kind of battled depression and kind of quit out of it, the feeling is, is, loneliness is *pause* is not really something you can necessarily express in words, is more of a, is more of a, is more of a feeling as opposed to something that you can explain, like being alo-, like feeling lonely is, 9 times out of 10 we’re not really lonely, it’s not knowing how to communicate or express ourselves to others which leads us to feeling that we’re alone, or like we’re alone struggling to do things or go through things and kind of deal with things and situations that’s why alone is a very, out of all feelings, that’s the most important one for me.

And how does that make you feel?

What’s that?

so like when you’re unable to express your feelings, you said how um, you can’t express yourself and communicate, and you know how does that make you feel?

Um… misunderstood, makes you feel like you’ve got, you’ve got the, the, your back against the wall, it makes you, well personally anyways, makes you, it could make someone feel like their voice is not being heard, it would make someone feel like they’re irrelevant, so all these, all these, kind of, the accumulation of all these feelings put together could really lead to being lonely and loneliness, and that, I think that, that alone is the most important bit of, the most important effect of feeling lonely, it’s like having, like having people, but not knowing, it’s, I don’t know how to explain it into words, but having people, but not knowing how to talk to them. It’s a very, it’s a powerful statement, but it’s very hard to explain unless you’ve, unless you feel a kinda thing yeah, so I feel like that is definitely something that could lead to loneliness.

So you might be like, for example, with um, I think from what I’m understanding you might, you were saying, you might be with, let’s say like 10 people or let’s say 100 people and still feel lonely.

Yeah, a hundred percent, so I can give you an example: so let’s say I have um… I have a collective of friends, we talk about anything and everything, so obviously they would say ‘Oh, I’m there for you, you know, I’m here if you wanna talk’, but *emphasised* you want to talk, but you don’t know how to talk; so you have people to talk to, but because you don’t know how to communicate that, you feel like although you are in a group of, although you are in a collective, you still don’t know how to get your pain across. So, regardless of how you are around people, you’re still alone within people. That’s… it’s a bit, it’s a bit of a complicated one, but, I’m not sure if it’s making sense.

And how does that make you feel?

*sighs* Just, just… misunderstood. Not, not, in somewhat, shape or form, it can also make you feel… *pause* irrelevant, like what’s, wh-, if I can’t express myself, then what’s the point of me being, kind of thing, like what, what, if I can’t, if I can’t express myself to my closest, to the clos-, to my closest peers, how do I express myself to people outside of that. So like, in terms of like, like myself, I’ve got a counsellor, but it took me three to four years to be able to get comfortable first, then open up, and I’m still learning to do that, whereas I’m more comfortable with her than I am with my collective of friends, so I still feel alone because then it all leads to not feeling like they will understand you, they won’t, they won’t get it, they will just shrug it off, they’ll just be like ‘this doesn’t matter’ or ‘what are you talking about?’, it’s also not being able to… learn to be able to get your point across correctly and how you thought and obviously the way society is right nowadays, as a guy there are things that you can’t say, certain things you can’t because you’d be looked upon in a certain way, so it’s really, it's really a difficult one, but I feel like I’ve been, feeling alone and the word alone really kinda resonates with loneliness or the experience of loneliness… yeah.

Is there anything else you want to say?

In terms of alone no, I think that, that really sums it up.

Sure. Do you want to go to the…

… to the second one? The second one is self-sufficient. I feel like um, it’s a bit off topic, but it is kinda of with topic; I feel like um… like being self-sufficient is great, because you get things done and you can do what you’ve gotta do and it allows you to kind of not depend from anybody else, but not depend-, not depending on anybody else also leans, leads *corrects* to loneliness, and what I mean by that is obviously I’m an, I’m an entrepreneur and having to do things alone you end up feeling like you can’t depend on anybody else, so no one, no one understands you, no one gets why you are making certain decisions, no one understand why you’re going as hard, so you feel like it’s you against the world, I’ve got this all by myself, I can’t, no one gets it, so then you kind of puts myself as an individual in a position where I can’t necessarily leave, open up to other people about certain things, because I know that they won’t get it, or that there’s no point, I might just do it myself and that builds a bubble of just… I wouldn’t, basically, loneliness because it’s like, instead of me opening up and seeking help, I’m like ‘forget it, I’ll do it alone’, and then with that there’s no growth, there’s no, you can’t get any better at doing something if you constantly do it alone, and you believe you’re self-sufficient. And it could, I, I personally believe it could lead to, to experiencing loneliness, like that drive, the same way it’s great it could also be, the same it’s beneficial it could also be a, for anybody that pushes it too hard because… eventually, you’d become lonely because you feel like no one understands you, you’re alone, you know what you are focused on, you know how you’re gonna get to that and there’s no point in explaining it because no one else would get it. So it’s just literally head on, and with doing that you kind of pull away from other people, friends, family, and when you realize it, it’s just you, yourself in your room working towards your goal, as opposed to kind of, working with people to kind of, as they say it te-team work makes the dream work, so I feel like that, that’s definitely one word that kind of summarizes the experience of loneliness… yeah.

So, you’re saying that being independent in a way, being someone that doesn’t necessarily rely on other people, contributes to, to feeling lonely

One hundred percent. I definitely, strongly, feel that way.

And, and how does that sort of impact you, like how does that, you know, make you kinda feel?

What’s that? Being self-sufficient?

Like, for example, like, cause you mentioned that, you associated loneliness with self-sufficient, being independent, doing things on your own, not needing other people, not relying on other people, um… I wondered how that makes you feel? That, you know, you’re doing things on your own…

Uhm… I feel like everything it just leads to lonel-, the word loneliness, it’s more, I think it, it makes you feel like it’s you against the world, you can’t, you can’t necessarily, as much as you do and want to depend on other people, you can’t because you’re so focused on doing it yourself and it only being you that understands, it’s like you want to create a pen, but only you know how to put it together, you know that I could ask you to help me create ten pens, but that would mean me depending on you or me waiting on you to do something, whereas I know that it could take me a year to do ten pens, but with you it could take me two years, so it’s just, it, it makes you feel like, obviously I’m not up to speed with what you are doing, it makes you feel like you’ll become dependent on other people, it, it, yeah I feel like it’s, it really will put you in, in a weird position. I wouldn’t, you’d feel like you’re more dependent on others as opposed to, because you’re so used to doing it alone, when you kinda incorporate others, it will make you feel like I, I can’t take this step ahead because I’ve gotta wait for this person or I can’t do this because I’ve gotta wait for this person, whereas if you just do it alone, it’s only you, you’ve only, you’re the only person to blame, you’re the only person that can get things done, by having been, being in that bubble it will only lead to you being lonely because everything else is caused by what you are working towards, so loneliness, sadness, depression everything comes from that, a hundred percent.

So, you’re saying also that, um, that you don’t want to rely on other people, you don’t want to depend on other people because they may, you know, sort of not speed up the process, kind of reduce it and not meet up your expectations…

Yes, one hundred percent. I think it’s just like being an, an entrepreneur, like myself, I’ve got a clothing line, so I have to depend on, so I would come up with an idea, I have to know, I have to meet a manufacturer, who would give the green light or the red light to the idea, who then goes ahead and creates it, whereas if I had ordered materials and machine myself, I’m self-sufficient, I don’t have to have the middle man no more, there’s no me depending on him to give me the green light, there’s no him, if there’s no way in term for me to wait until he can produce it, it’s all me *snaps his fingers* I do everything, whereas now that I’m depending on him, I have to understand that, that will come with setbacks, so which means that certain things might be delayed, that will lead to anger, that will lead to frustration, that will lead to annoyance, so it’s like… incorporating somebody else, I become, I’m no longer self-sufficient; I’m now dependent on somebody else and having that feeling is more, like I said, anger because nothing is now out your control, is not in your control anymore, you’re dependent on someone else to, to kinda get something done, and they may have other things that they’re doing as well. So, it really, it really, definitely it can lead to, to loneliness and I feel like, it is a big part of being loneliness and the setback that come from being self-sufficient is a lot more detrimental than being alone because when you’re self-sufficient, like I said, you block, it’s like an athlete, you block everything out, and you focus on the only thing that you’re doing, whereas if you were to focus on other things at the same time you no longer, you’re not giving one hundred percent to what you are doing, so distractions come in, um the way you’re… um… working or let’s say.. the way they’re performing, I feel there’s a lot of setbacks with being too self-sufficient; it can definitely lead to loneliness.

Um… so it seems to me that, you’re saying that, on the one hand, if you rely on people, first of, yeah if you rely on people, it may lead to feeling disappointed, not getting the stuff done in time, and that results in feelings of anger, upset and so on, but in the other hand, um, if you do not rely on people, then that just means that you know, you’re feeling more lonely.

Mmh… because if you don’t rely on other people and you get things done yourself, it’s like, it’s only you and the goal that you have, it’s only you and what you’re working towards, it’s only you and, and, like I said, with that athlete, like um… they’ve kind of lock everything away and focus on what they’re doing, so if something was to go wrong, there’s no one else to blame but themselves, there’s no time for any other, anything else besides what they want to work on and what they wanna focus on and I feel like, when you are that self-sufficient it puts you in a place, where it’s on only you, yourself and I, there’s no in between, there’s no, nothing at all, whereas if you’re not sufficient, you’re not self-sufficient and you depend on other people, work with other people, it could lead to a lot more, like, I want to say loneliness, but more frustration and emotion due to other things happening that you can’t control, that’s why, I kind of feel like anyways, could be wrong, but that’s what I thought.

Thank you. There’s anything else you want to say about it?

Nah, I think that would be it.

I’ve got it yeah, I’ve got it recording, for a second I thought maybe not.

Ooh.

Mmh, okay.

Yes, I think the third word is stubborn, I feel like I’ve just described myself in four words, but um yeah stubborn. I feel like stubbornness can definitely lead to loneliness.

Mmh

For, cause for me, I feel like stubbornness means, stubbornness for me anyways can be defined as not being open to listen to other people, not being able to understand what other people are saying, maybe not necessarily about yourself, but just being open to taking in what other people are saying; and I feel like that trait there will definitely lead to loneliness because if you’re not open to listening to what other people are saying, if, by the way it can be about yourself or in general, then all you have to go with is your own perception of life and your own perception on certain activities or anything at all in life and if you’re not open to other people, open to what other people are going to say or going to tell you, then it’s gonna lead to nothing but you being alone, you being lonely because if you’re not open to understand what somebody else’s got to tell you, then there’s no way of you improving and becoming a better person and that can only lead to you becoming lonely as there’s no growth because you believe what you believe and then it’s only that and… there’s no way you can develop around other people as well and kind of, ehm what’s the word? *snaps his fingers* coexist between people if there’s no, if there’s stubbornness and I feel like that will definitely lead to you being lonely.

Mmh

I think the word is extrovert, whereas the person is not necessarily, doesn’t fit in with the crowd too much, but it just do them. It become, they not, they, I feel like that would definitely lead to loneliness, that could definitely open towards experiencing loneliness, a hundred percent.

So being stubborn and not sort of being open to other people, also not relating to other people…

Yeah, exactly not um not being open to listening to other people’s… maybe um perception on things and understanding on things, and I feel like stubbornness in a whole, that trait itself doesn’t allow you to grow, so if you’re willing, if you’re not listening, if you’re not willing to listen to other people and you’re not willing to kind of build up an understanding based on what other people are saying and allow yourself to grow, there’s so much that can happen besides you being lonely and stuck within the same place and not, part of me, expand or grow, so I feel like stubbornness can definitely lead to experiencing loneliness.

And how does that make you feel?

*silence* Not to be stubborn, definitely, but um

No, I think um, what I meant by when you said that like if you for example say that um you know you’re stubborn and you’re not open to other people’s ideas and so on, and that makes you feel lonely

Yeah

And so how does that, can you tell me more about like, you know, your feelings and what happens then and things.

Um

So like how does that make you feel when…

So what like if you was stubborn?

Yeah like

Mmh *silence* I think, I think it probably made the, the, the worst case scenario would be misun- misunderstood, ‘cause I feel like stubbornness is, how you, how I would explain stubbornness is you having your own perception on something and not necessarily being open to understand it into anybody else’s, so um, you would definitely feel misunderstood, misinterpreted because you’d feel like no one else is understanding your point or why you feel that way, that’s why you’re not willing to listen to their point or how they perceive something. It could lead to you feeling low, definitely because it’s like regardless of what I say, people are not gonna understand me and definitely lead to you feeling lonely, ‘cause if you’re not mis-, if you’re not under-, if you’re not willing to listen, you’re not understood and you can’t communicate yours, what you wanna in a say other people understanding it, and cause communication for me is not only saying, but it’s also listening, it kinda works hand in hand, if you’re not willing to kind of coexist and listen to that, then I feel like that would definitely lead to you feeling low, unmotivated, quite a few things actually, but I feel like yeah stubbornness will definitely lead to a sense of loneliness, a hundred percent.

Mmh, so you’re saying that essentially um, if you, you know someone might be stubborn because they feel that other people are not, they’re being misunderstood

Yeah

Or, um… um… and then in a way that, and then that person will become stubborn, or you or whoever, and so, so it’s in a way, sort of a joint relationship.

A hundred percent, yeah

How does that, sort of, can you tell me more about that?

I think that can only lead to… I think it can only go both ways, it can, it, there’s only, I think, *doors open* it can kinda work both ways, it can go both ways, it depends on how it’s taken, it can never affect someone else to become stubborn, or it can eventually lead to just being not understood, which can lead to obviously misinterpret-, feeling that you’re misinterpreted, what you’re saying is not being understood correctly, it can lead to quite a lot of things, but I feel like yeah definitely lead to feeling low, un-understood, unmotivated, and probably even depression, ‘cause you feel like you, if you feel like not a lot of people understand you and you’re only going by what you’re believing, there’s so much it can go into, you just feel like, you feel alone. Yeah, I think that’s the best way of saying it.

Anything else you want to add?

No, I think that’s, that’s it on that one. Um… reserved, yes the last one is reserved. Mmh *thinks* I feel like reserved is more laid back, not really too open, not really too, not really open to communicating as much, that for me, I feel like it could lead to experiencing loneliness as well, ‘cause it’s like, you’re not really communicating as much, you’re not letting as much go, so you’re not really understood as much, you’re not really like, ‘cause I feel, like I said, communicating is giving as much as it is getting, so if you’re not giving too much, then in return you’re not really gonna get as much back, and I feel like being reserved can definitely lead to feeling lonely as well, like I said the people, I don’t know how to, um there’s certain qualities, there’s always that one person that,  the shy one, doesn’t really communicate that much, he’s not really understood, but people have assumptions on the individual, I feel like that definitely can lead to loneliness, because in a, in a collective, if you are the reserved one, you’re always the one that’s left out, you’re always the one that’s not really spoken to, so that could definitely lead to loneliness as well, and that could leave the person feeling low, like they’re not really, I keep repeating it, but misunderstood, I feel like that’s a very, that’s very key, ‘cause if you’re not giving away as much, there’s no way of anybody else understanding the person that you are, so I feel like that will definitely lead to some type of loneliness and leave the individual feeling low, depressed, um secluded from the group, or secluded from just where it is they are and what is they’re doing, it’s quite a few things, I feel like reserved is definitely one that could lead to experience-, the experience of loneliness.

So, you’re saying that being reserved, being quiet, being sort of not talkative, not expressing yourself, um can lead to feeling lonely.

A hundred percent, a hundred percent, I feel like it definitely, definitely, could lead to, ‘cause I’ve seen it with different characteristics and people during my life, like I said the example of the individual in college or school, that reserved person, no one necessarily approaches them, or communicates with them, everyone just draws assumptions on them. Instead of actually talking to the individual, people will just be like ‘yeah, he’s a bit of a, a bit of a weirdo’ so they don’t really approach them, so that can lead the individual feeling like maybe he is a weirdo, although he may not be, but just due to the fact that people have drawn that conclusion on him, it kinda sticks and that could lead them to feeling in different ways, so like I said low, depressed, lonely, just several different things.

Mmh

Yeah, I feel like that, that as well, that can be definitely something that could lead to loneliness.

Mmh

Yeah, yeah, I think that’s all.

Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Yeah, no I think that’s all.

Okay, cool, thank you.

Thanks, um so can we start by walking about what you’ve put first?

Yeah, so the first one in the first box, the one that’s um the place I feel most socially connected is the gym, um I don’t know why I would say the gym, it’s just, I have um socially connected, there’s a lot more, there’s a lot of different people in the gym, there’s a lot of ehm different characters in the gym, different origins, different, different backgrounds, that’s the one place where regardless of your ability, looks, anything it is that kinda that’s got to do with yourself as an individual, you always seem to click with other people, there’s always some type of togetherness, there’s always some type of connection where I may not be as able as the other individual, there’s always willing to help, it’s not every gym, but, every gym you walk into there is some kinda of a small amount of connectedness, and I feel like that’s one place where regardless of what mood I am in, what’s kind of happened during my day, if I go in there, I feel like theirs is an individual that I can connect with, that I can somewhat end up working together, or just doing something where I can forget whatever it is that’s happened during the day, I feel like that’s definitely one place where I feel the most socially connected.

Mmh, um I’m sorry is there anything else you wanted to say?

Yeah, no, no, no, that was it, really.

What I was going to say, so you’re saying that you like that sense of togetherness, you know that sense of um, you know talking to someone, and, and, and, being there irrespective of other factors and therefore, have a sort of sense of purpose…

Yeah

How does that make you feel?

I feel like it, it, it leads to you feeling part of something, like, although, I think it’s so weird, it’s, it, ‘cause, it’s so weird, although you’re not necessarily part of a group, but once you’re there working out together, you become a collective, you’ve come in individually, but at the end of it like you’ve built some type of connection with somebody where it’s a collective where I’m connected to somebody else to work towards, we’re working towards two different goals, but within that moment we’re helping each other achieve something and I feel like that, that feeling itself is very, very fundamental and very, very important, as it helps you, kind of, I can only talk personally but within that moment anything else that’s happened to you during the day, it’s forgotten, it’s only the thought, the sole, the sole purpose is to kind of work out and achieve something, to achieve a certain goal or um complete a certain exercise and I feel like that feeling there is very enriching because it allows you to, to grow, it always to feel, like when you’re in a, in a environm-, environment where you’re kind of connected with other people, it allows you to work harder, do better, because you feel a lot more free, there’s less pressure, there’s more just focus on doing what it is that is at task, so I feel like that is one place where I definitely feel socially connected, definitely.

You said something about achieving, tell me more about that.

Yeah like, I feel like in a gym you kinda go in there with a goal, that you don’t know, you may want a six-packs, you may want a bigger chest, bigger arms, bigger breasts, whatever, and I feel like… with, with the gym it kinda allows you to kind of grow patience as well, because it’s not an overnight thing, so you know that there’s a goal to achieve, it will take time, but you will still get there, and it allows you to kinda break down, like the whole system of the gym can allow you to break down you’re day to day life, you know that if you’ve got three targets a year, or um how can I, how can I word it, so let’s say you have targets and you know that ‘alright if I do a hundred of these a day for the next two months, I will achieve this’, so you know that, you can kind of relate that to your personal life and you know that if I don’t know work on your CV every day for a year straight, you know that it’s guaranteed you’ll get a job, so I feel like that process there kind of allows you to, to be disciplined and become better at doing what it is you do and it becomes easier for you to achieve what you need to achieve as well, so it’s very fundamental, the gym process and the gym on a whole allows you to kind of work harder on achieving and become better, and it allow you to work wiser, not harder when achieving certain things as well, which is really, really good. So, I feel like that’s definitely one place where I definitely feel somewhat socially connected.

Sure, is there anything else you wanted to say?

No, no, no, I think that’s it. I think in the second box I’ve got park. So why I’ve put park is a, so I’m an individual where… when things become a little too hectic I take walks. So like the one thi-, one thing I really like doing is walking in the park, so it’s alone, there’s no one around you, it’s just you and kind of just nature and it allows you to be free, like free from any like, I don’t know if it sounds a bit weird but from any human at all, so it’s literally just you and your thoughts and it allows you to kind of work on what it is that’s wrong, how  you, it gives you a free mind and free, free like fr-, free space and it allows you to just think and generate certain ways of how you’re gonna sort things out, how you’re gonna work towards better things and how you’re gonna strategize to kinda move forward, I feel like that’s the one place where I can go without a phone, even with a phone, and still feel like disconnected from everybody else, just in my thoughts and I can focus on what it is I gotta do. I feel like that is the most, the one place where I feel the most, keyword would be lonely because I’m around things but physically I’m there, but mentally I’m more focused on different things, so I’m like lonely, I’m alone, I’m, I’m reserved, I’m just, it’s just me and the walk, the more time I’d be walking for so long I won’t even know until I see a reference, and so I’m like ‘oh okay, right, I walked this far’, so, no, that’s definitely the one place where I feel the most lonely and the most kind of at peace, and the one place where I can just focus on whatever it is I’ve got to focus on, so that’s definitely…

So, you’re saying that being in an environment where you, you’re not in contact with people, um it’s just you, um can give you a sense of peace…

A hundred percent

Can give you a sense of um… sort of yeah…

So that’s a sense of like just, just of freedom

And, and , and um what does that sorts of um associate, or how does that relate to you and loneliness, um you know what I mean?

I feel like within that moment you’re, I’m alone, I’m not with, like, like I said loneliness is, like I said in the first kind of set of questions, loneliness is being around, surrounded by people, but being alone, so when I’m in the park there’s other people there, there’s people doing what they’ve gotta do, there’s, there’s bats, there’s animals, there’s trees, but within that moment mentally I’m, I’m lonely, I’m just, it’s just me and the walk, me and what I’m thinking about, or me and what I’m trying to work towards; so I feel like that definitely is one place where you become free of anything that is, let’s say, holding you back or stopping you from achieving things or whatever really, but that’s definitely one place where you feel the most lonely, not in an, it, it’s not as lonely in a vulnerable way, but it’s more lonely in a way where it’s you and your thoughts, so you, you’re alone, you’re, there’s no one kind of in a way of you developing things or thinking, there’s no distractions, there’s no, you’re not depending on anybody else to think for you, it’s literally you and your thoughts and nothing else, so I don’t know I think that’s the best way I would explain it, loneliness, but yeah that’s definitely one place where I feel the most, the most lonely.

Okay, thank you.

Yeah

Is there anything else you wanted to add?

No, I think that’s it, no I think that’s all.

Thank you
