Interview 48 – Female, 23, Barking & Dagenham

Interviewer:

Can we start by talking about what you’ve put in box 1, please?

Interviewee:

Yeah, so, um, my mom – she passed away when I was 9, so when I go visit my friends and I see the way they relate with their moms, it really makes me sad, it makes me feel lonely, because of their relationship – I never had that type of relationship with my mom. Yeah.

Interviewer:

Hmmm [as a way of gesture to show compassion. You’ll see this gesture quite frequently throughout the interviews]. It sounds like what you’re saying is you know, um, when you go and see your friends and when you see that there’s their mom there and the dynamic of their relationship, it makes you feel, when you see that, it makes, feel, yea, it makes you feel lonely,

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] Yeah

Interviewer:

It makes you feel like you want to have that.

Interviewee:

It reminds me, that, yeah, I don’t have this thing in my life. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And, how did it feel when you were 9 and lost your mom? When you were younger.

Interviewee:

Well, I just thought it was part of life – we’re all gonna die one day. It’s alright now. It’s cool.

Interviewer:

And, how do you feel about it now?

Interviewee:

Sometimes, I even forget about not having a mom but when I do see people and their moms, then I remember, and I try not to look at pictures as well, because it reminds me everytime, so yeah.

Interviewer:

When you say, pictures, can you tell me more?

Interviewee:

Yeah, I’ve got pictures, so, and I’ve got on my phone as well.

Interviewer:

Ah, picture of your mom.

Interviewee:

Yeah, yeah.

Interviewer:

And, when you see like your friends with their moms, like what kind of thoughts do normally go through your head?

Interviewee:

Just, I wished I had my mom. I wished I was able to talk to my mom about this. I wished my mom would get me that, you know – sometimes, my friends would call me ‘oh my mom just got me this’, so yeah.

Interviewer:

Sounds like it makes you feel like you wished you could have that.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewer:

And, what is about moms that you value, for example?

Interviewee:

Their advice and their love.

Interviewer:

Mm. When you say ‘advice’ can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah. Because, I did have a step mom and um, I know how she relates with her kids, if they get in trouble, if they need someone to talk to, they always go to their mom. And it’s the same with my friends as well. If they need something sort of advice, they always go to their moms, they call their moms, so and I feel like that’s the best person to talk to.

Interviewer:

So, what you’re saying is moms could help with, um, advice, if things, let’s say go wrong or if they needed anything, any support…

Interviewee:

[Interrupts], Exactly.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel when you don’t have that – you can’t go to your, go to someone like her for advice?

NOTE*: [She says something really slowly that transcriber can’t hear or understand.]

Interviewer:

mm.

Interviewer:

You mentioned ‘love’ also. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

I’ve seen, um, friends that have got kids, and I know how they love their children. I don’t think anyone else would love that child that much except from the mom. And I’ve seen it with family members as well, so, yeah.

Interviewer:

And, how do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

I just hope that one day I’ll have my own child to show that kind of love. Cause I remember how my mom, I might be young, I remember how she loved me, yeah.

Interviewer:

Hmm [as a way of showing compassion]. [some seconds of pause]. Sounds like the two elements that you value would be advice and love.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

So, what did you actually write here, in box 1?

I said, ‘my mother passed away when I was very young, so when I see people my age associating with their mom it makes me sad and lonely’.

Interviewer:

When you say, like, seeing people your age, so…

Interviewee:

So, cause, most people I talk to, they’re my age, which are my friends, so. And then family members, so.

Interviewer:

Hmm. [Long pause]. And, you said you have a step mom, is that correct? And, has that in any way help with regards to…

Interviewee: [interrupts] Sometimes I’m able to talk to her but not every time.

Interviewer:

Hmm. [Long pause]. And how does it feel like when you people outside that aren’t not necessary your friends and are with their moms, for example? How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um, doesn’t really have any impact on me because I might not know that that’s mom and daughter – it’s not really shown. I don’t really feel anything. It’s just things I see around me. Yeah.

Interviewer:

Hmmm. [Pause]. When you say that you see things around you, you mean when you see friends that you know and you know who their moms are…

Interviewee: [Yeah].

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 1?

Interviewee:

No.

Interviewer:

Thank you very much. Can we talk about box 2 please?

Interviewee: It says ‘when I’m out of work’, so – can I generalise everything or I have to do it individually?

Interviewer:

Is that OK if we do it individually? You can generalise at times but we’re gonna basically go through them one by one.

Interviewee:

So, when I’m out of work, obviously, I don’t get to do anything so it makes me think of a lot of things. As for a 23-year-old, I’ve actually been through a lot but I don’t like talking about it if you get what I mean. So, when I’m out of work, my brain thinks about a lot of stuff, like, cause, I’m not, I haven’t got people taking my attention, so I think about a lot of stuff when I’m out of work, puts me in a bad mood and then I realise, you know, I’ve actually got no body. So, yeah.

Interviewer:

Hmmm. How does it feel like when you say you don’t have anybody?

Interviewee:

It’s not a nice feeling, knowing that there’s no one. It’s not nice. So, I tend to, what you call it, keep myself busy every time.

Interviewer:

So, It sounds like what you’re saying you try to cover it up by keeping yourself busy?

Interviewee:

Yeah, so that I don’t have that chance to actually think about anything. It’s basically the same thing with this one [referring to box 3].

Interviewer:

You can generalise if you like to, by the way.

Interviewee:

Yeah, don’t worry. You can go back.

Interviewee:

It’s basically the same thing [referring to box] when I’m alone, so it’s cause you were coming, you were coming at 4pm, I was actually out, so, when I’m not doing anything, I like staying with my friends, you know, they know my aunts, I know what time my aunti gets back, I come home. So, yeah, to just keep things out of my mind and.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘to keep things out of your mind’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Like I said, I’ve been through a lot so sometimes I just remember things and I’m not happy about that.

Interviewer:

So, you’re saying that when you’re on your own, when you’re alone, the thoughts will kick in.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

You don’t necessarily like them.

Interviewee:

I know it’s not a good thing to think obviously ‘cause it’ll lead to depression, so I, I don’t like it, which is why I try and you know keep myself busy or be around people. Yeah.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like what you’re saying is, you know, when you find yourself alone, that’s when the thoughts come in and so you don’t like being alone and having to think a lot, so you basically keep yourself busy by going with your friends and doing different things.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

How do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

Well, with my friends, life is a better place, but when they’re not available, I just have to, if I’m not at work, I just have to, maybe put myself to sleep or I don’t know. Yeah.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘life is better with friends’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Cause we get to, we laugh about things, we do things together, yeah. Yeah. It makes worry-free around my friends.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. Takes your mind off

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] Things, yeah.

Interviewer:

[Pause] And when you’re not around them that’s when the thoughts normally come in.

Interviewee:

Yeah, when I’m not at work as well.

Interviewer:

When you’re not at work.

Interviewee:

If I’m by my side for too long, I can be alone for three, four, five hours.

Interviewer:

And then, what?

Interviewee:

Sometimes, I start to think, sometimes I can do one day actually, two days.

Interviewer:

Sounds like what you’re saying is after that you want to be around company, because it gets uncomfortable.

Interviewee:

Uhuum.

Interviewer:

So, what you say here that you, you’ve actually written this down that you ‘start to think about lots of things, which put, you, me in a very bad mood, when you say ‘lots of things’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Like I said, I’ve been through a lot. I know want to go.

Interviewer:

Sure, don’t.

Interviewee:

Yeah, yeah.

Interviewer:

So, what you’re saying is during those moments when you’re not at work or with friends, that’s when thoughts that you’ve carried away since your experiences, will make you, will, will come and make you remember them.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

Mmm. [Long pause]. And, how does it feel when you feel, when you know that, you know, you’re covering your loneliness, or, when you’re, yeah you’re just covering your thoughts and your loneliness by doing other things?

Interviewee:

Um, it makes me, when I’m, when I’m not thinking, I actually forget that I’m lonely, until I’m back to it. So, I don’t really feel that I’m lonely when I’m with people, when I’m busy or at when I’m work or here.

Interviewer:

Sounds like you don’t like being by yourself.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

[Long pause]. And that’s when the thoughts come in and it’s not very nice.

Interviewee:

Uhum.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 2?

Interviewee:

No.

Interviewer:

Thank you.

Interviewee:

You’re welcome.

Interviewer:

Can we talk about box 3, please?

Interviewee:

It says, ‘when I’m alone’, so it’s basically the same thing. We established the fact that I don’t like being alone here [referring to box 2], so when I’m alone I think and…yeah.

Interviewer:

So, what did you actually write in box 3?

Interviewee:

When I’m alone I tend to think a lot because of negative things I’ve seen and experienced in life.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like you experienced a lot of negativity in life.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

[Long pause before the interviewer starts] And how does it make you feel when you constantly find yourself constantly thinking?

Interviewee:

I feel like I need help sometimes [laughing].

Interviewer:

Mmmm.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘you need help’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Maybe to see a therapist or I don’t know.

Interviewer:

[Long pause]. And, how are you, and um, I guess, how does it make you feel when you’re around people and you’re not thinking about your thoughts?

Interviewee:

I feel good, happy.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. [Pause] Has it ever happened, I guess I’m trying to think you said when you’re with your friends you don’t necessary think about your thoughts. Has it, when you, has it ever happened, when let’s say thoughts came and you were with your friends?

Interviewee:

No. Not that I remember.

Interviewer:

And how does it make you feel when you’re alone?

Interviewee:

I don’t feel okay. I just want to be with somebody.

And when you say being with somebody, can you tell me about that?

Interviewee:

Maybe be with my friends. Sometimes, I just want to go back to work, or go see my cousins.

Hmmm.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

Um, is there anything you want to say about box 3?

No.

Interviewer:

Thank you.

Interviewee:

OK.

Interviewer:

Can we talk about box four, please?

Interviewee:

It says ‘at night before going to bed I sometimes I have to cry myself to sleep because I’m lonely’. So, like I said, obviously, my aunti is in her room, I’m in my room, and um, the thought just comes from nowhere and it could be about my mom, it could be about maybe what happened during the day, it could be what’s happened in the past, it could be maybe what my friends done to me, so, and I’m a very emotional person, so it really puts me down and I cry for every little thing, so. If, this [referring to box 4] brings me back to this [referring to box 1]. If I had my mom, maybe, this [referring to box four] wouldn’t happened, like, you know, I can come back home, talk to her, cause you can’t really talk to people these days, everyone’s got their own problems. I feel like if it was my mom, I don’t think she would ever get tired of me, so.

Interviewer:

Mmm. So, it sounds like what you’re saying is you find night times difficult.

Interviewee:

Yeah, very difficult. [Long pause] Sometimes it’s even hard to go to sleep, at some point, I had to go to my GP to give me medication, I told him I couldn’t sleep, they had to give me medications to put me to sleep.

Interviewer:

[Some pause] And, how do you feel about that?

I feel like I can’t change that. I can’t bring my mom back. I can’t bring back the memory, the, like, the memory of what happened in the past will always be there. So, as long as I’m lonely, I’m going to have to continue thinking about stuff. Sometimes, TV can be boring to watch, so you just turn it off, yeah, try to sleep but.

Interviewer:

[Pause] And when you said that, you, um, you had to cry yourself to sleep, is it because the thoughts come or is it because you feel lonely?

Interviewee:

Because I feel lonely.

Interviewer:

If you had your friends, for example, around you, in that moment…

Interviewee:

It, it, it never happened. Sometimes I sleep, I sleep over at my friends, and I don’t have to go through that.

Interviewer:

When you say, you know, sometimes you cry yourself to sleep because you sleep lonely. Can you tell me more?

Interviewee:

Yes, because I have no siblings as well. I think that’s another reason why. So.

Interviewer:

You say you don’t have any siblings. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

No brothers or sisters, so. There isn’t really no body to, you know, mess around with, and, yeah.

Interviewer:

[Long pause]. How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

I can’t change that. So.

Interviewer:

Sounds like what you’re saying is, you would have preferred to have siblings.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

It also sounds like you just don’t like the idea of being alone.

Interviewee:

Being alone, yeah.

Interviewer:

What is it about being alone in your own company that…

Interviewee:

I think I just like being around people. That’s what it is.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. [Long pause] How does it make you feel when you, cause I know you mentioned that when you see your friends, with their moms, it makes you feel lonely, it makes you feel you wish you had that. I wonder how it’d make you feel when you see friends with siblings.

Interviewee:

It’s annoying, sad, lonely. [pause]. It makes me wish I can do what they do with their siblings.

Interviewer:

[Long pause]. What is it about night time you find difficult?

Interviewee:

I think it’s just, I don’t know what it is. Not sure.

Interviewer:

Mmm. Maybe, what is it about night time that you feel most lonely?

Interviewee:

No one to talk about my day with, no one to, I can’t really say, no one to care about how my day went, cause my aunti asked me so, I can’t really say that but, you know, like I said earlier, everyone’s got their own stuff, they’re busy, I can’t tell her everything, so, yeah.

Interviewer:

Mmm. Sounds like you’d, you’d, you’d like to have someone to talk to about how your day went, how it goes in general.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

When you say you don’t have people to talk to about your day, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Mmm…. I don’t know.

Interviewer:

Sounds like you like the idea of this talking, and just, yeah, like being heard.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

[Pause]. And being cared for. [Pause]. And how does it make you feel when you don’t have this?

Interviewee:

I feel like I’m used to it now but sometimes it can get to me.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

When you say, it can get to you,

Interviewee:

Yeah. I’m used to it but sometimes I remember it and yeah it makes me remember that I actually don’t have these things. Yeah.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. [Pause] Is there anything else you want to say about box four?

Interviewee:

No.

Interviewer:

Thank you very much.

Interviewee:

You’re welcomes.

PART 2

Interviewer:

We move on to part 2 now. Can we start by talking about what you put in box 1 please?

Interviewee:

Yeah, places I feel most socially connected, I put, um, clubs, so when I go clubbing with my friends, I see people having fun, then I can have fun myself. It makes me forget about, you know, life, for, it’s yeah.

Interviewer:

Hmmm.

Interviewee:

Interviewer:

[Pause] Sounds like clubbing can take away life.

Interviewer:

Enjoy yourself.

Interviewee:

Uhum.

And people travel, depends on where it is, I’ve got families in Manchester, you know, so, if it’s in London, we have people from Manchester coming down, we get to see each other, talk, and yeah.

Interviewer:

Join the fun. So, when you feel like fun, can you tell me more?

Mmmm. So, that’s where you feel really socially connected.

Interviewee:

Uhum.

Interviewer:

And, you got work as well [referring to what the interviewee had written].

Interviewee:

Yeah, cause I work with kids and I love kids so much so when I’m around them, it’s like I’m around my friends as well and then my colleagues at work as well, we talk, we do have like, maybe every month where we go out.
