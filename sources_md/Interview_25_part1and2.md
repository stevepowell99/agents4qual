Participant number 25 – Female, 18, Hackney

Interviewer: Okay, well thank you. Um… can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the first box please.

Interviewee: Okay so in the first box, I’m talking about… someone can feel lonely by like just- by feeling left out. By seeing people in a group and then like you’re just not involved… [interviewer: mm] in like their conversations. Like… in the second box, I have antisocial, like staying at home-

Interviewer: Oh sorry, um before we go onto the first one, I’m gonna uh dissect um… kind of go deeper into each- into each box. Sorry I’m just gonna close this door a bit more. So um, so basically, just to reflect it back to you with the first box, you’ve put basically one person being sort of secluded from a group of people [interviewee: yeah] and- and you wrote… someone [interviewee: someone being left out] being left out.

Interviewee: Because like… if you’re seeing people in a group and like you know them, you can see them having fun, you’re by yourself, you’re gonna- you’re gonna feel their excitement and then realise you’re by yourself. You’re not with anyone like… being in a group of people like… socialising is fun like.

Interviewer: Mm. So… um… so it sounds like what you’re saying is… being sort of- not being with other people [interviewee: yeah] um is what you associate with being lonely.

Interviewee: Yeah. Like… not having people around you. [Interviewee: mm] Like… me personally, I’d feel lonely if I didn’t have anyone around me. Like I would just feel like- I would just feel depressed.

Interviewer: Mm… and how does that make you feel, kind of um…

Interviewee: I mean like it don’t- it don’t happen to me. But like I’ve seen it happen to other people and it’s just… I feel sad for them. Like it’s not- it doesn’t look nice. [Interviewer: mm] I wouldn’t wanna feel that way. It’s depressing. [Interviewer: Hmm] Yeah. [Interviewer: um…] It’s not a path I would like to go down if I’m being honest.

Interviewer: Yeah. So can you tell me more about what… this in- this- the- the lone- the alone person here that you wrote in your box one, being sort of secluded from the group here, can you tell me about the nature of their relationship and what- quick what might happen that might lead to them kind of separating the- the group and the individual.

Interviewee: Like maybe- like maybe they could be in a group because they wanna talk about them. Like- like you would feel- how can I say it. You would feel… you would be paranoid. Like I’ve been paranoid before. Par- being paranoid is not nice, like imagine like people could be talking about that person. They could be looking around, turning their heads. And you just feel… like kind of on the spot.

Interviewer: Mm. So when you say paranoid, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… they could be crossing them… saying like oh, look at like… how they look- look at how they’re dressing. Um…

Interviewer: Who would be saying that?

Interviewee: The people in the group.

Interviewer: Would be saying it to- to each other about that-

Interviewee: About that about that person [interviewer: about that person] standing by themselves. [Interviewer: Just standing by themselves] Yeah.

Interviewer: What would- what would they be saying about them?

Interviewee: ‘Cause people are like that. People-

Interviewer: No no, not why. Sorry, no no no not why, I meant- I meant like what would they be saying about that individual that’s standing alone.

Interviewee: Like look at them by themselves. They look lonely. Like… people can be horrible. Or… they could turn around, look at that person, and be like they’re by themselves, should we invite them over? Like… should we go talk to them, make them feel more comfortable? [Interviewer: mm] Like it could be- it could just be- it could be that person’s starting a new school [interviewer: mm] and… like feeling lonely on their first day. Like these people like… could just be nice and go over to them. Not make them feel lonely.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say people are horrible, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… I’ve experienced being bullied in- when I started secondary school. I got bullied for always changing my hair colour. I got bullied because I wore make up. Like… I got- I got bullied for wearing shoes that other people weren’t wearing. There were just things like that.

Interviewer: And how did that make you feel?

Interviewee: Made me feel lonely. I was depressed at one point. And I stopped going to school. I stayed at home.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like what you’re saying is, because you wanted to do the things that you wanted to do…

Interviewee: Other people didn’t like it. But… like I… I came back from it. And then they put me down. Because… gotta live my life. It’s what I want, it’s not what other people want.

Interviewer: Mm. It sounds like people judged you for doing the things that you wanna do.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I now put it behind me. Like… I look in the mirror every single day and I just see me. Like… I call myself beautiful every day. I put- I bring myself up.

Interviewer: Mm. And um… so when you were in school, and then people would kind of- so it sounds like what you’re saying is when you were in school, people bullied you because you wanted to be yourself, you wanted to be different. So for example [interviewee: yeah] if you wore shoes [interviewee: yeah] that were different to what others wore-

Interviewee: Like some people used to call me skittles because I’d change my hair like every single day, my hair colour would be different every single day.

Interviewer: And people would judge you and… and call you skittles. How did that make you feel?

Interviewee: I- I kind of had to laugh, ‘cause like that’s funny. Like… how can you call someone skittles ‘cause they change their hair colour like it was a- it was funny, I can’t lie. [Interviewer: mm] I even called myself skittles.

Interviewer: Mm. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box? Actually, before we move- oh sorry go ahead. I didn’t mean to…

Interviewee: Not really. Just like not it’s- just not nice being left out. It’s not nice.

Interviewer: How would it make you feel if you were left out by friends?

Interviewee: I mean like, I probably just wouldn’t speak to them again. Like… I don’t- I don’t really care. But… [interviewer: mm] like friends come and go.

Interviewer: When you say friends come and go, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… like… I’ve had this friend for a long time [unintelligible 7:54]. We’ve been friends for a long long long time. But… when I mean friends come and go, I mean like… I’m not- like, I’m not always friends- like how can I say it. Like there’s not ever one friend that’s always around. Like there’s always one time that… they’ll have to- they’ll say- they’ll be like I’ll meet you and then next day- that day comes- that time will come, they’re meant to meet you, they won’t meet you… and I was like, cool so you left me. Then I don’t talk to that person. [Interviewer: mm] And then like- I don’t know like friends come and go, you make friends every day, you lose friends every day. Friends [unintelligible 8:36] and stuff like that. People get taken from you like that. People leave you because of arguments. You make friends ‘cause of work growing up, going different places.

Interviewer: And how does it make- how does it make you feel, like losing a friend-

Interviewee: I mean like I’m proud of myself. Like it makes me feel- makes me- makes me a stronger person because… I learn from- I learn from my mistakes. Like if I know that I’ve had a friend before and they treat me in a bad way, if someone else comes along and I see that they’ve had- that they’ve had- they have bad vibes and negativity and that, I won’t- I won’t be their friend. I wouldn’t talk to them. [Interviewer: mm] Like, I’m not gonna make that mistake again. [Intervieer: mm] And yeah. That’s it.

Interviewer: Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Thank you. Can you talk- can you start talking about what you put um [interviewee: um] next.

Interviewee: Okay so the second box- in the second box it’s like staying at home like… you’re being antisocial, you’re keeping yourself like in your room, in your house, away from everyone. Um… I mean like- it’s- I’ve experienced that loneliness because… my boyfriend’s gone to jail recently. I just keep myself here in my room. Like… yeah. It’s not healthy for me, I know it’s not healthy but um… yeah. Have a job interview coming up and stuff like that… like… that’s like the worst kind of loneliness, being stuck in a house, having nothing to do. [Interviewer: mm] Like just not wanting to be with a lot of people like… yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like what you’re saying is um… being at home and having nothing to do makes you feel lonely.

Interviewee: Yeah. Like… there’s nothing really for me to do at home. Um… the only thing I would do is watch TV and that’s about it. Like… don’t really go on my phone. Yeah. Just like not even talking to anyone whilst you’re at home, like even on the phone there’s stuff like that. Like you just like- you’re keeping yourself to yourself. And… like sometimes it can make you feel like you’re in a bubble. Like…

Interviewer: When you say sometimes it makes you feel like you’re in a bubble, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… it’s like pretty much being in a cell, right? And having four walls to look at. Just… like staying at home like… like you just sit there, like you think about stuff whilst you’re sitting there, like some- like you can’t help that your mind wanders and thinks the way your brain thinks. Like you can control yourself but if your think- like you have to be at home, you have to be lonely. Like to be- to be thinking all of that, it’s being lonely. Like, to be staying at home by yourself is being lonely.

Interviewer: And you put- just to refer to the box that you um- number two- so you put a picture of a house [interviewee: mm] and then someone’s eyes coming out of the house- uh window.

Interviewee: Yeah, looking at-

Interviewer: And then you-

Interviewee: -kids in the park.

Interviewer: Oh, kids in the park. So can you tell me what [interviewee: um] this represents and what that [interviewee: like] one represents? Thank you.

Interviewee: That’s kind of like um… the person in the house has spotted people in the park but like they’re in the house. Like it’s not that they- they’re not allowed to go out, they don’t want to go out. Like… like they just wanna be at home. Like they just wanna stay at home, they don’t wanna go out. Like… it’s not even- sometimes- it’s not even like some people like put themselves in that situation. Like being lonely, sometimes it- it happens for a reason, like… I felt lonely because my boyfriend’s ended up in jail and… I just don’t talk to anyone. And that… that person wants to go out but… they don’t want to go out because they just wanna be by themselves.

Interviewer: When you say they don’t want to go out, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… um… I don’t know, like sometimes like being with people can just… I don’t know, like make you think. And like it can just m- like… I don’t know. And yeah, that’s it for that. [Interviewer: mm] Hmm.

Interviewer: So um… and how does that make you feel? Not [unintelligible 14:48]- how does that make you feel that your boyfriend is in jail at the moment?

Interviewee: I mean like… I’m upset. Uh… I’m going through a depressed stage. But… like it makes me feel lonely because I only ever spoke to him about my problems, only spoke to him about like the good things that were happening in my life… like I speak to my mum but I feel like I can open up to my boyfriend more. [Interviewer: mm] Like… yeah. Sometimes I just wanna be lonely- sometimes I want to like just sit in a room and just think. Like it- I would say that it makes me stronger, I’m not gonna lie. [Interviewer: what-] It makes me prepare myself for worser things coming.

Interviewer: What, being by yourself?

Interviewee: Yeah. Like… I know it’s a struggle being by myself right now but there’s more- there’s more serious things to be coming. Like I’m young.

Interviewer: And when you say that you can- you can open up to your boyfriend more than you can open up to your mother, [interviewee: mhm] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… like, I just feel like sometimes my mum don’t listen to me, or my mum don’t care. But I know- I know- I know my mum deep down does care… hopefully. [Laughs]

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I mean like it’s not a bad thing. Just- I just like- I kinda prefer to talk to my boyfriend more than my mum because- like my mum will listen to it, she’ll take it in, but I prefer it when my boyfriend’s feeding me back with advice and stuff like that. Like how- what I could do to improve… whatever.

Interviewer: Mm. And when you said… like you see people outside in the park, as you’ve drawn [interviewee: mm] in the picture, [interviewee: yeah] but you wanna- so when you see people outside in the park, like- wh- what makes- how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Like… okay so… let me just say if I was in the person’s shoes. [Interviewer: sure] So if I was in my house and I was looking outside seeing people in the park, but I’m feeling lonely, like… I don’t know, like… it’s like… like not all the time I would want to be around these people, but because like- I would just- I would want- I would like- I would like to think I- I would like to have my own mind to think. Um… like… okay so, if I was… this is gonna sound so confusing but-

Interviewer: No, don’t worry.

Interviewee: Okay so, if I’m here and these people are in the park yeah, and I’m looking out and I’m feeling lonely, I’m not gonna wanna be with them for the simple fact is… it sounds weird but it would make me feel more lonely. ‘Cause like… sometimes when- when I’m with people, it’s not the people I want to be with, or like sometimes the vibe isn’t how I would want it to feel. And like… sometimes I would think what’s the point in even going out. Like do you get what I’m saying?

Interviewer: Mm. So when you say that you um… sometimes don’t like to be with the people or you don’t get the vibe that you want to feel-

Interviewee: Like you’ll just have the loneliness and… like you’ll just feel like social anxiety. I would.

Interviewer: Um… how does that make you feel? When you, for example, if you did go out with your friends or yeah.

Interviewee: If I was to go out with my friends…

Interviewer: Like ‘cause you said that they’ll go- you don’t wanna be with them [interviewee: yeah] you- [interviewee: I mean] but how would it feel if you did go with them?

Interviewee: I mean I would like… I would just probably come home. And really like… sometimes I go out and I’ll just be like… I didn’t wanna even be out and I’ll just walk home. [Interviewer: mm] Just for the… small factors, like I just don’t like being out.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel, um… being at home?

Interviewee: I mean like… it’s not a problem… like… so, if I’m at home by myself… I’ll just… I don’t know. Wait just say that- say what you said again please.

Interviewer: No I’m just saying um, ‘cause you said you don’t wanna- you don’t wanna spend time outside, [interviewee: yeah] if you’re outside you just walk back home, right? I just-

Interviewee: How does it make me feel, just being at home by myself?

Interviewer: Yeah, when you just want to be at home.

Interviewee: Yeah so, like… I mean like it annoys me, the fact that I wanna go out but like- but like I just don’t want to go out. Like it’s weird… like I, like I wanna go out, but I just like I don’t go out. Because… just like… sometimes I’ll feel like anxious about going out. And I’ll just feel anxious for the simple factors like… there’s so much stuff happening- happening on the streets these days. I’ve lost so many friends because of it. And just like… and yeah.

Interviewer: When you say you’ve- you- you- you say um… the streets, there’s lots going on, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more?

Interviewee: I mean like… silly gang violence. Like people doing acid attacks and stuff like that. That’s just dangerous. People- like the stabbings, the shootings, people are dying for no reason. Like probably over silly money problems- silly mo- money problems or just because an area’s- like some- someone’s from a certain area and I think it’s stupid.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is it’s not safe to be outside-

Interviewee: Yeah. Like sometimes… I keep myself to myself at- at home just because certain things like that, certain things just ‘cause I wanna be by myself but… the world’s dangerous out- now these days. And it’s gonna get worse. It’s going to get worse.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: It makes me sad really because I know a lot of people and like… it’s not nice losing friends. I’ve lost some very very good friends.

Interviewer: I’m sorry to hear that.

Interviewee: [Unintelligible 23:13]

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel when you’re outside? And you feel that it’s- like… it’s unsafe.

Interviewee: I mean I get paranoid a lot. Like… I’ve had my phone stolen before, like I always kind of like constantly look over my shoulder. Like I’m always aware when I’m outside. Like I don’t really wanna feel like that when I’m outside. I just wanna be relaxed when I’m walking and it’s never like that.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that impact your loneliness?

Interviewee: Like… I don’t know. Like… it just makes you think like am I the only one… like that actually like… is looking over my shoulder the way I am, feeling the way I am an dlike being outside and feeling the way I am because of all of this that’s going on. Like am I the only one like feeling like this.

Interviewer: When you say… am I the only one feeling like this, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… am I the only one feeling like… like I don’t know like am I the only one feeling that like… I’m- that I’m losing too many people at once. Am I like- am I the only one that’s like constantly looking over my shoulders like the way I do. Am I the only one feel- feeling as like anxious as- as I- as I do. Like just things like that.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel, having to- thinking- having to think like this? Thinking if you’re the only one… and that.

Interviewee: I don’t know, I don’t really think- I don’t know. I don’t know how that makes me feel actually. [Interviewer: mm] I’ll tell you it’s annoying. [Interviewer: mm] Like… it’s frustrating I would say actually.

Interviewer: So it sounds like… it frustrates you for you to have to think about oh like, I need to check… for you to have to look over your shoulders or be anxious about what might happen to you when you’re out and things like that, right?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay thank you. Um… can we start by talking about what you’ve put in your third box please?

Interviewee: Yeah um… in- in my third box I’ve written down not speaking to someone about life, your worries, ambitions, can make you feel lonely. Like um… like yeah again I put myself in- I’d put myself in like this situation. [Interviewer: mhm] Like I thought about myself in a way. Like… so like… not speaking to someone about like how your life is going and like sometimes it can make you- [interviewer: sorry, apologies] sometimes it can make you think like does anyone even care about me? Like, do people even think- think of my name anymore? Like… like not talking about your worries or your ambitions can make you feel lonely because… like it’s nice to be praised but like even if it’s about something little like helping someone up the stairs with their bags or something. Like just not talking to someone can make you feel lonely. Um… I used to have um… a ther- a therapy worker um… like we would talk about getting my CV done. We would talk about um… just stuff like what’s going good in my life, what things can I do to improve. And like just coming out of there like I felt like it was a weight off- lifted off my shoulder- like I felt good about myself. Like just speaking to someone can just make you feel ten times better. Like… yeah, that’s it.

Interviewer: Thank you. So… so it sounds like you not speaking to anyone about your life about [interviewee: yeah] your ambitions um… about your what’s- what- what’s- what you might struggle with and so on, can actually make you feel-

Interviewee: Yeah. Like not just- like not even- like not even just like having like advice. Like the advice is nice to just have there. Like if you have nothing- if it’s just the last resort and you have nothing else to think of or something like that. [Interviewer: mm] I just think- I think it was good to talk to just someone. It’s- it’s not good to… it’s not good to s- like… take it all in and just keep thinking about it. It’s good to talk to someone and let it out. [Interviewer: mm] If you build that up, you’re just gonna depress yourself.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel, being in that situation and not talking to anyone about these?

Interviewee: Um I mean like… it dep- it would depress me a lot. Like… just not expressing how you feel to someone can… not make you feel alright. Like it’s just simple things. [Interviewer: mm] Like- even when you’re just like walking past someone, like you know them, they don’t say hi or anything like that… you think oo. Like… like that might be embarrassing to some people. Can make you think oh no one wants to speak to me.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel? [Interviewee: I mean…] When you think that nobody wants to speak to you.

Interviewee: I mean… they’re not the only person in the world. So I don’t- it don’t annoy me. But… like… it’s just, it would be nice if like I was to say hi and you was to say hi. Like even just walking past someone and saying hi, it’s just- it can make their day ten times better. Walking past someone and say oh I like your shoes, like they could’ve felt sad, you just said that their shoes are nice and they’re happy again. [Interviewer: mhm] Like it’s taken them- them out of a bad mood or something.

Interviewer: Mhm. So it sounds like you like to talk to people, you like to-

Interviewee: Yeah. I like to socialise. [Interviewer: mm] It’s my specialty.

Interviewer: And you also like… when you said- you said- when you… went to see a therapist, you guys put together a CV [interviewee: yeah] and an- [interviewee: yeah, yeah] and it made you feel good.

Interviewee: Yeah. It made me feel like I’ve achieved something. Like… I done something good with myself. [Interviewer: mm] Like I’m- I’m putting my life on track. It just felt good.

Interviewer: Mhm. So it sounds like you like to… you like to achieve things.

Interviewee: Yeah… yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you. Um… do you want to say more about that box? Okay. Can we talk about what you’ve put in the final box please?

Interviewee: Um, in my last box I’ve put not having friends at all. [Interviewer: mhm] Um… not having friends is when you should start to worry. Because… like… you’re lonely, you’re- just not having friends at all is… that is very very depressing. I’ve- I’ve been… I’ve had a point where I’ve had no friends at all. And it’s not nice. You’re just by yourself. Um… like, there would be things that you would see on the internet that you would wanna do with your friends… and… you just think oh, that would be a nice day out… or… that would just be like a fun activity or that’s- that’s a nice place to eat. And then you’re just like, there’s actually no one that would- I would go with. Like no one would come with me. And… yeah. Uh… put me in a depressed state.

Interviewer: When you said there are things you see on the internet that you wanna do, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like it will be going to the… like it will be going across the things- what are they even called? D’you know what them things are called? You know the O2, and then the things go across in the sky. They’re like little lifts but they go across the… yeah.

Interviewer: Um at the O2 centre?

Interviewee: Yeah. It’s at the O2.

Interviewer: I’m not sure.

Interviewee: Um they’re like… you know if you was to go like… skiing or something and you have them lifts in the air.

Interviewer: Oh you mean the- the telecabins.

Interviewee: Yeah. That’s what it’s called.

Interviewer: The ones you sit on and they take you up to the-

Interviewee: Yeah yeah, like I was looking at that one time. Um… I wanted to there but I had no one to go with. There were nice places to eat. Like go trampolining, swimming, just like… or library. And like no one would come. Yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like you wanna do things… um… but you just don’t find that… [interviewee: yeah] friends are-

Interviewee: You- no, it’s not- just that like… I would just have no one around me at all. At all.

Interviewer: Mm. How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I mean at the time I was sad because… like I’m getting older, there’s- there’s things that like I’m gonna wanna go, I wanna do different things. I’m gonna wanna say oh yeah, I’ve done this, I’ve done this, I’ve had a good time doing that. I’ve gone and enjoyed myself. And stuff like that. Like by not having something- imagine just- imagine being with friends, and then like they’re all talking about having a good time and oh they’ve done this. You’re sitting there. You haven’t done one good thing. Like you have nothing to talk about on the topic. Like- that would be embarrassing. [Laughs]

Interviewer: Hmm. So it sounds like… you- well you may go out with your friends, and then they talk about sit- the things that they’ve done, and you don’t have… because- because maybe you think that you have lack- you lack the experience or you don’t have as much experience as them [interviewee: yeah] in terms of like what they’ve done and so on. You feel embarrassed because you don’t have- you don’t have much to talk about to them. You don’t have much to…. yeah, converse with them about your experiences.

Interviewee: Mm yeah.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I mean like it’s frustrating. Yeah. It would- it would be annoying. [Interviewer: mm] Like you have nothing to talk about with your friends. But… like just having no friends is just… you want friends in life, I’m telling you. Like… I’m sure- I’m sure everyone would want more friends than enemies in life. You need people around you. Like especially when you’re depressed, you’re going through rough times, like you need a family member or… like… you’re just going through a hard time.

Interviewer: Sounds like you like to have friends. You like to be around people.

Interviewee: I mean I have loads of friends. But… I don’t really associate with all of them. I’d say… I would say I keep my close friends close and my friends- if I ever need my friends, I will- or if I ever need someone, then they’re a message away or something. Like my friends are always gonna be there. I’ve made good friends.

Interviewer: So you’re saying that you have some close friends that you can rely on?

Interviewee: Yeah. I can rely on my close friends.

Interviewer: Mm. And when you’re out with them for- and… how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: When I’m out with my friends?

Interviewer: When you’re out with your friends that you- um… [interviewee: when I’m out with my friends-] feel connected?

Interviewee: When I’m out with my friends, how- how do I feel?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: Like when I’m out with my friends… now… like I dunno like… we’re always having fun now. Um… I mean like I’m happy I have the friends I have now because they support me in whatever I do. Mm… they don’t lie to me when I say do I look alright. [Laughs] I mean… like I have- I just have good friends and I’m grateful, I’m happy. I love them to pieces. [Interviewer: mm] Yeah, [interviewer: mm] I would say, make friends in life, it’s good, [interviewer: mm] you need them.

Interviewer: Mm. And how do you feel when you’re with your friends um… and then- ‘cause you mentioned earlier that sometimes you don’t have… you can’t contribute much in the conversation, [interviewee: yeah] because they talk about their experiences. How does that make you feel, when you’re in that situation?

Interviewee: I mean like- I s- my friends will be talking about oh they went to a different country or something. And they’ll be like oh the water was so nice [unintelligible 40:24], and then people will be like oh where did you go? And I’ve never ever- I have never in my life come out of the UK. I’ve never been on a holiday. And when I’m just there like oh, I’ve never been on holiday, like what, no no, aw you need to go there, there, there. It’s so nice. Aw, in it? In it? The food’s nice, aw in it- duh-duh-duh. Like then they’ll be- they’ll just be talking about it and I’ll be like hmm yeah… hmm. ‘Cause I don’t- what am I meant to know. Oh yeah, I’ve had good food in London. There’s the great taste of America. That’s about it. Hmm.

Like there’s different people to talk to, like um… there’s different like- there’s so many people, like you just talk about different things.

Like… I don’t- it’s not even that no one don’t wanna come over, like I don’t invite anyone over or just… like I don’t- like I don’t really… when I’m home I don’t do anything for the simple fact is I’m not here a lot. And… like yeah. I’m more time I’m out, away with the fairies and doing whatever. So like… yeah. I would say the most I do at home is watch TV. And that’s about it.

Interviewer: And how does it make you feel when you’re at home?

Interviewee: Mm… I mean like, I feel safe here and stuff, but it’s like… I don’t know there’s just… there’s nothing at home for me to do. At all. Like apart from just eat and watch TV. Like I don’t play board games, I don’t have board games. Like… I read books but like it’s… it’s not my favourite thing to do so I wouldn’t really read the bo- a r- a book. Like yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say watching movies, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… like… I will sit here, I’ll watch films and stuff… mm… yeah- but I think more time like what it is when I’m on my phone and I’m like just like my just watching- like seeing what other people are doing. Like I’ll be so into it I’ll be like oh, I wanna be there, I wanna be there. And like I turn around and it’s like oh, I’m at home. Like, there’s no one here. There’s no party here. I don’t know what I was thinking, I don’t know why I’m so happy. Hmm. Like… yeah. I would say- I would say though, being at home like- I would just say- I would just say… being at home is not healthy anyways.

Interviewer: When you say like- w- you know, you go on your phone and- and you see people on your phone doing things and then you’re home, [interviewee: yeah] how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Like lonely. Like very lonely. As if like I almost just wanna get up and go out just to anywhere. Just because I don’t wanna be at the house anymore.

Interviewer: Sounds like what you’re saying is when you see you friends on social media, when they’re out at a party or some sort- [interviewee: mm] some sort of-

Interviewee: Like just in the moment, I wanna be there. But it’s like yeah, I don’t wanna be there. Like, I don’t know what it is, like I’m just- I’m not a party person. Like… ‘cause in the moment like it just looks like they’re having so much fun, like you just wanna be there. Hmm.
