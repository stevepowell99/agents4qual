Interview (Participant 40)

Key:

I:	Interviewer

R:	Respondent

I:	Can we start by talking about what you've put first please, thank you.

R:	So, in the first box so like the image I will associate with loneliness. It's just quite simple…it's just maybe a group of people in one side having a conversation or whatever they're doing that there's someone else by the side maybe watching them thinking about joining in or something but not really.

I:	 So, it's basically this person erm…

R:	 Yeah, off to the side.

I:	 And this is a group of people.

R:	 Yeah.

I:	And what is this individual person thinking?

R:	Erm…I don't know. Maybe just like they wish they could join in or had a group or something along those lines.

I:	And what it is about this group for example that this person wants to be with them?

R:	Maybe it's just a few of them…maybe they look like they're having fun or something yeah.

I:	So, this group seems like…what you're saying, they're having fun and this other person who is alone was to join them having the fun.

R:	 Maybe yeah.

I:	 And the fact that this person is not there, how does that make him or her feel?

R:	Maybe that they wish they could join in, or they wish they had their friend group of that, or though or something.

I:	So it sounds like what you're saying is…you know sometimes people want to be a part of something people want to be a part of the group but they're not and that what makes them feel lonely. Can you tell me more about that?

R:	Erm…I just use an example on the top of my head. For example, I've got like a very close friend group like this, and then sometimes you know, when we’re hanging out in the area and stuff, we’re talking about stuff. Maybe it’s a big private or like an inside joke sometimes it’s a person they’re also there. They’re kinda getting on it what…kind of like ‘cause something was just private jokes or something within your group, but then one person might wanna get in on the fun but they can't really…if you know what I mean.

I:	Yeah.

R:	‘Cause they’re not part of the social group That’s just what’s on top of my head I can think of.

I:	And how does that make that person feel?

R:	I'd say they kind of feel a bit awkward probably just being there not being part of it. It’s awkward.

I:	So, this group that consists more than one person or 2 basically it sounds like…what you're saying is they seem to be having fun…you know and this person was alone wants to join in on them but here she can't

R:	Yeah.

I:	So, when you say they’re having fun, you know, can you tell me more about that?

R:	Just you know it doesn't have to be an activity. It could be just a group of guys…you know just having some banter about something, having a laugh just talk about stuff. That’s all.

I:	And how does that relate to loneliness?

R:	Erm…What I mean if you don't have a good plan that you feeling like, you know…you can't really discuss stuff that you wanna discuss with someone if you're alone I guess.

I:	So, it sounds like what you're saying is that…this person who is alone doesn't really fit in with that.

R:	He might do, but it's just probably he just can't really get in because like…you know…this group might have a history. They might have been friends for a really long time, and this person they just maybe know kinda acquaintance, but not really in that sort of friends could be like that.

I:	So you're saying that basically based on history, you basically don't friendship and people build friendships?

R:	Yeah.

I:	And if you don't necessarily know these people long enough, then you don’t necessarily fit in.

R:	Yeah

I:	And what are they thinking? What is the group thinking of this individual you think?

R:	Mm…they might not be thinking anything. They might be oblivious to the fact they might just be having fun they may not realize you know they might just think things are fine… unless this person overtly tries to join in and you know…try to say that he was joining. Then, they might be aware, but I’d say they may be oblivious to the fact they could just be having their fun, they don't really know.

I:	So, because these people know each other for a long time, they get to hang out…and this people who doesn’t know these people for a long time can feel lonely by…can feel lonely because of that.

R:	yeah because of that

I:	So, what you would say…that final concluding point about this session is based on…you know…the experience of loneliness.

R:	Erm…I guess I would say…

I:	How would you summarize that?

R:	I don't know. I guess someone can be lonely for a very long time if they don't have friends from early, early on in their life. Then that could cause a belonging for a long time. ‘Cause just from personal experience, the friends I have, I know them since childhood. So, that’s why it’s like we almost never not be friends…you know…what I mean so yeah. So, I guess someone new might be hard for them to just trying to make new friends like this. That’s probably what I would say about that.

I:	So, you said like from early years can you tell me more about that?

R:	Erm…mostly school primary school, secondary school, yeah the friends I've known I've known them over years primary school, secondary school, college…not university. University we kinda went to different University. But even in the local area where I live, all of my friends are local as well. That’s kind of why like a close, kind of friendship group.

I:	So you've basically [cough] excuse me…so you're saying that a lot of the friends that you hang out with today are actually your friends met back in  you know number of years ago in childhood. When you’re at school elementary etc. etc. And even though you went to different university, but because you live in the same neighborhood, you get to hang…

R:	Yeah, still hang out obviously. We can still come out and meet up here which ever how far someone’s university is.

I:	And how was it for you in university when you are away from these people that you know from childhood?

R:	My University…I never have my childhood friends with me, but I had some people that I knew from the local area who are just wasn’t super close to them. But then obviously, I see them in my uni. They were just like, see you, see you. And then in university we are became more friends with them. So now yeah…actually I guess there's a guy or two that are new, sort of like you know that when you walk pass an area, but then you can see them in university they become close friends of mine. But I only know them for 3, 4 years as opposed to like my childhood friends. But still was close the friendship I guess it depends on their experiences that you share friends or not, groups.

I:	So, you're saying that basically when you’re at university, you basically became friends with people who you met known before…but you weren't really friends with them?

R:	Yeah pretty much.

I:	And when you said that…basically someone new comes along they because they don't know…I'm just trying reflect what you’ve said 'cause you said that you basically met friends when you were in childhood…and that those relationships carried on right? But if someone new comes along it takes time for them to…yeah.

R:	Yeah, yeah try to get in 'cause obviously, if you don't have the same history as the group does, it can be hard probably to relate them or even talk about stuff that they’re talking about because you might not know what they just talking about.

I:	Sounds like what you say it takes time to build friendship.

R:	Yeah, it's also like a comfort thing. You’ll be comfortable with your friends, but with someone who is not your friends someone who is new, you don't be as comfortable to share some stuff sharing some jokes perhaps, some other might be you know private jokes that you don't really wanna tell off to people about it takes time That’s what I’m saying.

I:	Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

R:	No, I don't think so.

I:	Thank you. Can we talk about what you put in box two please?

R:	So, the second box. So this is what I feel when I try to draw it…it doesn't really look like.

I:	No problem.

R:	When I'm on the tube, you don't know anyone when you’re on the tube. So that’s kind of way I guess I feel lonely that's the most lonely place I can kind of think of. Tube is just it's just everyone is completely random you never see someone you know…and you just stand in there you know with other people just waiting to get into So that’s what I’ll say. Well, I feel lonely probably.

I:	So it sounds to me that places that you don't know people can make you feel lonely

R:	Yeah, I guess so…Yeah, I guess when I’m on tube as well I’m just thinking how kinda a way to get to where I'm going so…I can see someone I know but the tube is just no one you know. So that could make some feel lonely.

I:	And how does it feel when you're in that situation?

R:	Erm…I don't know it just feels like just feel something you dealing with…something you just want to get through you know for short time health and for longer journeys just…something you basically just dealing with.

I:	So it sounds like you're there you just wanna you know.

R:	Go through it and get done all basically.

I:	And have you ever been on tubes with your friends?

R:	Yeah yeah occasions sometimes you need to get go somewhere you know some far, far and that’s completely different experience…you know…you could stand over each other seat with each other. It’s just completely different talk to each other you don't need to think about strangers and stuff around you.

I:	Sounds like you like seeing familiar people.

R:	Yeah yeah.

I:	And how about the crowd itself from 'cause I know can get sometimes…

R:	Pretty crowded. Yeah I don't like that I hate…when it gets really crowded everyone is just in everyone’s personal space…you know…you just feel really awkward I guess.

I:	When you say personal space, I know you mention privacy once before you about private jokes and present jokes, can you tell me more about it?

R:	Yeah it’s just…when the train is busy, it gets really busy and everyone is just like face to face with each other. And this is so weird ‘cause this is like, you know what I mean, it’s like a [phone rings] sorry… it’s like a I guess an intimate space, but not really ‘cause you're in public and so you're forced to share it with other people. And you know people get really close, close they forced to ‘cause there’s no space on the train. It’s not something I like.

I:	Sounds like what you're saying is like a personal space it seems that kind of invaded you know.

R:	Yeah that's…yeah I think so but then obviously you think to yourself no one’s choosing to do it no people everyone just wants to get somewhere the train just packs where you just giggled it, you know they’re gonna complain or nothing.

I:	and how does it make you feel being in that situation where you feel like your privacy has become kind of overtaken and stuff?

R:	It’s just a bit maybe a bit stressful like again I was just like I would like to get over and get done quickly when the space opens up the train I feel like relieved now It’s not as packed as it is that means I don't just stand face to face with someone

I:	And when you say not standing, not having to stand face to face with someone, can you tell me more about that?

R:	Just you feel like you feel kind of like…I don’t know. It’s like, kind of under scrutiny like you can't really do anything, but stand still like a plant because everyone is face to face with everyone each other like watching each other and you just have to completely…you know…you just be like a plant of what in it and just wait till the train journey is over.

I:	It sounds like you find that situation a bit uncomfortable.

R:	Yeah yes it's uncomfortable completely doing nothing. You don’t feel comfortable doing anything you know it’s like, for example, you can see you know some people come in with you know huge backpacks or stuff like that and they shuffle in right about, moving in and then everyone looks at them, wish they would stop. It’s kinda like that you think alright they won’t move or anything.

I:	So just to reflect on what you've said…sounds to me that you know…because you don't necessarily know anyone on the tube that can make you know generate feelings of loneliness.

R:	Yeah, yeah of course…‘cause of complete strangers so could make you feel lonely.

I:	It also sounds like what you're saying is it gets quite uncomfortable in there and everyone is kind of in each other spaces and that can lead to feeling of…

R:	Yeah just feeling uncomfortable 'cause people you don't know. That’s what I’ll say.

I:	Is there anything else you want to say about box 2?

R:	Box 2, I don't think so. There shouldn't be.

I:	Okay thank you. Can we talk about what you put in box 3 please?

R:	So, in box 3 I just wrote down “scared”. So, I feel lonely you could be feeling scared also you know 'cause you're alone. You know people might not like being alone unless you're really comfortable…you know…being alone but if you're not you just know maybe you're somewhere…So, I was just thinking imagine somewhere you never been before somewhere far away and you’re alone you might bring on feelings of being scared That’s what I was thinking.

I:	So, would you say that being in a place that you don't know would make you scared? Can you tell me more about that?

R:	Right it's just the…I guess they feel alone you don't know where you are, you don't know anyone, there so there's like an element of uncertainty where you don't know for certain you know…how your day is going to go, move something that is unfamiliar.

I:	So, you're saying basically being in unfamiliar space can make you feel lonely.

R:	Yeah.

I:	Can you tell me more about that?

R:	Trying to think of an example…I think probably just comes down to where you feel comfortable, if you feel very comfortable somewhere or not if you're not comfortable somewhere where you don't know anyone then could have make you scared could have make you scared of maybe interacting with someone that you don't know in order to you know get help with whatever…or something you need maybe that can make you lonely I guess.

I:	Sorry, can you repeat the last part again?

R:	I guess that can make you make you feel lonely if you are forced to maybe trying interact with someone you don't know. It could make you think you know perhaps things you don't know in what yet you know can make you feel lonely…I guess.

I:	So, when you say being forced to interact with someone, can you tell me more about that?

R:	Yeah I guess what I'm saying is that…if you are somewhere familiar but…and you know people around it, if you need something need to ask something, you can ask someone who you know with confidence basically 'cause you know them. You have a (unclear 20:02) with them if you're in a completely different place surrounded by strangers, and you have to speak to someone because you don't know anyone can make you feel uneasy. That's what I think.

I:	Sums up what you're saying is…being a crowd or being in a space where you feel like you don't know very many people or anyone that could basically lead to feelings of loneliness.

R:	Yeah 'cause it's basically literally being alone although there’s people around you, you don't know them. They’re just other people…so that can make you feel lonely ‘cause you're the only one there that you know who it is ‘cause you know that’s yourself.

I:	So, you're saying that you could be around a lot of people, if you don’t know them,…

R:	It can make you feel lonely.

I:	And how does that make you feel being in that situation?

R:	Yeah…I say just…just you know, just like I guess you don't want to be there or you just wanna be somewhere where you do know people. That's what I'd say. Like if I went to a place where I don’t know anyone, probably I can’t wait to get out of here, go to place where I do know people.

I:	And then can you just…and how does that related to being scared when you’re in a crowd of people that you don't know?

R:	Erm…because you can get erm… literally you don't know what's gonna happen if you know if anything is gonna even happen. It could just be you know, it just works through your brain and that can cause fear if you just start to overthink stuff you know I don't know anyone here, how should I speak to people, how are they going to respond to me…stuff like that could just induce fear in yourself.

I:	So, what you're saying is erm…being in an environment that you don't know people can…can cause some feelings of fear because you might you don't know what's gonna to happen.

R:	Yeah that's what I’m saying.

I:	When you say you don't know what's gonna happen, can you tell me more?

R:	It's just been uncertain if you’re, for example, if you go to where you work and you know exactly how your day is gonna go. It’s like you know your journey, you know who's gonna be there, you know who you gonna talk to, and you just certain of the day. But if you had to go somewhere else unfamiliar, you just can't really plan the day how it’s gonna go 'cause anything can happen.

I:	Would you say anything like…

R:	Well I think I'm not sure but just guess for example if you going somewhere familiar, you know exactly where to go, how to get there. But if you have to go somewhere completely new to you and you might be thinking, “no, no, I’m there”. Imagine don’t find anyone to trying ask for help or ask for you know just some guidance that can you know that uncertainty of not knowing can make you feel scared.

I:	So what you're saying is being in an environment where you don't know people or or that you don't know like what's happening you haven’t planned around That can make you feel scared and potentially leading you to feel lonely.

R:	I’d say they’re tided together ‘cause you’re lonely in that place ‘cause you don’t know anyone. That's probably what causes fear…I’d say that way around.

I:	And you said you’re scared of I mean… scared of what might come essentially is that what you're saying.

R:	Yeah…or just just 'cause it's like an unknown quantity, you don't know what could happen there if anything something nothing might happen. But 'cause you don't know that 'cause you're not sure over the place. Also, if something does happen, you are alone there so you don't have any that you know for backup. So, that kind of loneliness can make you feel scared .

I:	So not having people that you trust around.

R:	Yeah it's about the trust I'd say.

I:	Can you tell me more about trust?

R:	Well…I guess yeah throughout your normal day, you just had to trust that everything you've been doing for half of the many days. You have been doing is going…you just have to trust that it's going in the same way all the time, and you know…Trust in people that you know as well to be the same yesterday, and today, and tomorrow so…if you don't have that trust if you go somewhere unfamiliar to you, you won't have that certainty. So, that can make you scared.

I:	is there anything else you wanna say about box 3?

R:	No, I think that's all.

I:	Okay thank you very much. Can you start by talking about what you put in the final box please?

R:	So in the last box, I put nervous. So kind of ties with the previous box but it is a different feeling you may not being scared. It’s quite different I guess to be nervous being nervous. I would equate it you know…just like being anxious about something, you’re not really scared you just thinking a lot about how something would go down you know…if something would happen or not and just being uneasy I guess generally if you're somewhere alone.

I:	When you said being so I'm just gonna reflect back what you’re saying so it sounds like you're saying that you basically feel nervous if you…if you don't know how things might happen or how things might end up or go down.

R:	Yeah.

I:	Can you tell me a little more about that?

R:	I guess an example I would use is once I was on holiday with my friends, and we got lost and split up. When they told me where they were, so i had to do is basically get a cab and go there. But I guess the whole journey, I was nervous. I was thinking, does the cab driver actually know where to go? As in have I told the cab driver the right place 'cause obviously those bit of language barrier. So, the whole ride was just nervous. But I end up in the right place. So, it just makes you uneasy I guess the whole time and I was alone by myself so made me feel quite nervous.

I:	So it sounds like you weren't sure if you have given the sort of right directions to the taxi driver.

R:	Yeah. And obviously the taxi driver would just go where you tell them to they won’t know what you mean even if it's a…if you might have said something slightly wrong he won't know what you mean really because he’s gonna go to where you told him to…so the whole feeling of like that journey being uncertain where I'm going to end up makes you feel nervous. You just basically just hope that you end up in the right place. That's how I was feeling.

I:	So, it sounds like that um…being uncertain about the future being uncertain about the outcome of something can make you feel nervous and then lonely.

R:	Yeah with loneliness, I would say…Yeah being alone doesn't make you feel nervous 'cause the exact same situation happened to me in another holiday with my mate I was having one person with me, and I was complete I almost didn't care after like even if you do get lost…you know. My friends were like next to me because something now so I have no being with someone else just one more person completely negating the feeling of nervous or anything so yeah…it does tie in to being lonely.

I:	Sounds like…yeah I think what you’re saying is being on your own and being in situation, or in an environment where you don’t know what's gonna happen connected to like…

R:	Nerve-racking.

I:	Yeah nerve-racking. And being there racked and being nervous can make you feel lonely.

R:	Yeah. 'Cause you are alone that’s what’s causing I guess the nervousness 'cause you’re alone and the way with one another person you don't completely fill it out. So you feel comfortable even if things go wrong, you think it’s alright…at least i'm not alone.

I:	Sounds like you’ve been having just someone with you can you make a difference.

R:	Yeah just give one another person can make a difference.

I:	And as we…from what I understand…you're saying that because if anything worst happened, at least you have someone else with you.

R:	Yes. So you could you know just it’s just being alone you know uncertain of something, and not sure it will make you feel scared or nervous but there's one another person you think, “okay, there’s someone I know here”. “there's someone I know that’s with me”, and you know…you could figure it out we could…even if you don't figure it out, you know we would someone…would know someone you could trust it just makes you feel at ease.

I:	Sounds like you don't like being alone.

R:	Maybe in unfamiliar circumstances, I wanna like to be alone being alone I wouldn’t say is something I don't like…sometime I’d like to… I would like to you know just go somewhere by myself to do…if I’m gonna run an errand, sometimes I just wanna you know go to gym the time I wanna go take as long as I want or need erm…come back by myself without any disturbances or something But there's somewhere you know, where you know or something. But if you are in somewhere unfamiliar you would tend to be with someone.

I:	Just I just want to ask this question too, if I may- how does that make you feel like you're in that situation where you don’t have a lot of people around you they don't know what's happening and you know…and you’re in that you know…circumstances that you don't know what's happening and maybe set either nerve-wreck and so on what kind of feelings or emotions, what kind of thoughts do you have?

R:	It's just no knowing how things are gonna go, it makes you anxious you just want to quickly get to the…you know…the result you just want to know like, okay am I going to be fine, or not in this situation waiting around alone, or something makes you feel nervous or scared I think yeah.

I:	So it sounds like uncertainty whatever it might be you’re in an environment that you don't know what's happening or just generally being uncertainty about things can make you feel scared or anxious or nervous and even lonely.

R:	Yeah. I say if you alone that’s what’s causing those feelings so being lonely is what causes being scared or anxious or nervous in those situations, but if you're not alone is completely…is a completely different experience.

I:	Is there anything else you want to say in the final box?

R:	No I think that's it for the final box.

I:	Is there anything else you want to say about any other previous boxes.

R:	No, not really that's everything.

PART 2

I:	Thank you. Let's move on to the second part of the interview. So this is basically about a place where you live near that you feel more socially connected, that makes you feel more lonely. We can start with box one please.

R:	So…box one is just like this is like a local area neighborhood. It’s basically a football pitch alright. Then, next to it there's a bunch of seats and then this is literally where everyone congregates in the whole area you know. Usually in the summer is the most busiest. Literally, everyone…so for example, my group of friends would be on this side the younger kids they will play in there sometimes. People would play football with random people from other area. They just cause danger to the football pitch they come up playing and there will be maybe like a bunch of older people to decide. There’s even a park and stuff so is literally like everyone in the whole local neighbourhood is like this…like you know…hot spot of an area. Also, there’s like you know building and stuff all around these people It’s just really local to everyone that's what I feel yeah…yeah feel most socially connected.

I:	What does it say here?

R:	So, I just wrote er…the local hang out where…almost everyone comes out to that hang out or relax.

I:	So, what is this environment…so I know there’s football, a soccer, football kind of…

R:	Yeah, there's a football pitch these are just bunch of like benches like in a…you know, kind of wide-open space everyone just sits down there have a chat on.

I:	And when you say that you find this particular place more socially connected, can you tell me about that?

R:	This is basically like the middle of the neighborhood that’s why. So, all around you there’s buildings where people who you know live, and people who just know you as well and yeah…as in literally everyone comes here to hang out, all age groups.

I:	So it sounds like you like this area because everybody goes there, you know people that you know are there.

R:	There's always someone in this area that you know so, for example, I have to go to work I have to walk pass this area going to work and coming back home from work and there’s always someone that I know and you know…just have a quick hello and stuff. So this is just it literally where almost every one you know is.

I:	so it goes back what you said earlier that you know you like this place because you know a lot of people there and and you like the fact that you see familiar faces and everybody’s there.

R:	Almost every faces are familiar face in this area.

I:	And that makes a difference.

R:	Yeah.

I:	And how does that make you feel being in that environment?

R:	Just very, very comfortable. Like even the area where we…this is…is not particularly like it's not really a safe area but nothing has ever happened to us or anyone. We know in this area at the same time so it's kind of like a…I don't know how to say…there's always stuff going on, you know there’s like drug dealers there, you know…other stuff going on here. But there's never ever be like a dangerous thing that’s happened here ever. In the summer we barbeque and stuff you know…everyone comes out, even older people comes out and people come with their kids ‘cause they know it’s completely saf Nothing, nothing really kinda happens there even though like from the outside, you’ll assume that this is a rough place to stay. But it’s completely…probably the safest space it could be so that’s kind of like feel there.

I:	When you says it can be the safest place, can you tell me more about that?

R:	'Cause everyone there knows each other, and they know of each other, there's not gonna really be any kind of hostility. There everyone is friendly with each other, so does not yeah…I can't think of any occasion where there has been any hostility here in that space. So it's completely friendly space for everyone.

I:	So...because everybody knows everybody, so it makes a safe environment.

R:	Yeah.

I:	And where is this exactly? How far is it from here?

R:	From here like 5 to 7 minutes-walk here. It’s like literally that way…It's quite ingrained in the community as well. It’s quite a lot history. It’s been around for a long time this space like you were just there, you know…probably since I think I wanna say the 70s or something it's been there for a while. The look has changed but it's basically the same space.

I:	So…yeah because because everybody goes there…everybody that you know is there where you feel very socially connected.

R:	A very familiar space. That's what I’ll say.

I:	Is there anything else you wanna say about box 1?

R:	No I think that's all.

I:	Thank you Can we talk about box 2 where you feel most lonely.

R:	Most lonely. So, I just wrote down in this box in the city for example like…in the city basically like Liverpool street. Sometimes, I need to go down there to do some shopping, or you know…other stuff. It just feels lonely ‘cause there’s no one I know there, not at all even like…so none of my friends work in the city there in Liverpool Street. They work in other places. I don’t work there, so when I…even though Liverpool Street is quite close to me, once I got there, it’s completely different, like there’s no one I know there all and you just feel the vibe is really different.

I:	When you say the vibe is very different. Can you tell me more about it?

R:	It's very like you know…there's a lot of hustle and you know, everyone’s rushing to places. It’s very busy, noisy you know…seems like no one’s there knows each other. Everyone just quickly running pass each other, trying to get to where they’re going. It’s just you know, a very different place in the city.

I:	Sounds that you don't like that busy hustle bustle.

R:	Yeah when it’s busy, crazy like that…I don't really like it.

I:	And how does that make you feel when you are there?

R:	it makes me feel like…I wanna be in a rush as well. It makes me feel like…I wanna quickly get in and out of that place that…seems like everyone else is doing that as well …seems like everyone is alone as well. That’s why I feel lonely I guess over there. You don’t really see people walking together. You just see individuals rushing to different places alone and stuff, so it feels very different from box 1.

I:	So, it sounds like you've found Liverpool Street quite…you know…the most lonely place in your experience because it's quite busy, loud. It’s a big hustle and bustle. Everyone is just rushing to get to somewhere.

R:	Yeah. it seems like no one there knows each other. That's what you kinda feels like- the feeling in that place…there's other places like that as well. But I just use Liverpool Street as an example because that’s sometimes I need to go, and I feel like.

I:	 So it sounds like you don't like the city life of London very much.

R:	Uh I don't know if I say that…I mean…I enjoy living here. I live right next to city, so I don't know…I never lived somewhere quiet really, so I wouldn’t know where to comparing to. I don't know if I'd be able to live in somewhere like completely isolated with death quiet. I think it needs some sort of like…some sort of you know, just some liveliness around here.

I:	So what is it about Liverpool Street? Is it too lively or…?

R:	Yeah…but it’s lively not in a good way, where it just doesn't seem like anyone there is having fun if you know what I mean…'Cause obviously it’s the workspace everyone around there is working. It just feels uh…yeah I don't really see anyone having fun there, or even talking to other people

I:	So it sounds like what you're saying is- if you know it's busy and it's lively, but because it's function is for work It’ s not really engaging…

R:	Yeah. It's for work, not play yeah…There's no kind of fun, doesn't seem like there's fun there.

I:	Sounds like you like environment that the functioning is…

R:	Social.

I:	Yeah …is there anything else you want to say about box 2?

R:	Erm…no I don't think so.

I:	Great. Thank you very much. We’ve come to the end of the interview.
