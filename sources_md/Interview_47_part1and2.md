Interview 47 – Male, 24, Barking & Dagenham

Interviewer:

Can we start by talking about what you’ve put in box, please?

Interviewee:

Right, um, it’s easy – sometimes, you’re so high, and you know, just walking on the street and just walking on the street minding their own business and day-to-day life, just, anybody and I mean anybody, just, someone just saying ‘hi, how’s your day going? How are you doing?’, just ‘hi, how are you?’, it’s literally, it’s literally, what anybody can do, like it can change your day, it can change anything. Like literally. More time when I’m, when I’m going about my business and someone just says hi to me randomly, especially when I don’t even know the person, I smile, I know it’s weird to like, I don’t know the person but you know what? It’s good. Cause yea, ‘hi, you aright?’[smiling as saying it]. Yeah, that’s, that’s that’s it.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like, um, um, you feel that this is lacking and that’s what makes someone, you or anyone feel lonely?

Interviewee:

Literally, yea, because not everybody has…has as much friends and…not everybody can walk around the street with confidence, do you understand what I’m saying?

Interviewer:

Yeah.

Interviewee:

So, literally, like, even you walking, you can be walking on the street with your face, you’re gonna (1:32) do your stop and what not. And just someone walking pass you saying, and just asking you, just anybody, just, you’re just walking past through his face but needy (1:43) and what ever and a random person just says to you ‘hi, do you mind me asking, how did you get that?’ You don’t have to explain, I know that, but, you know like, we’re in a world of human beings, you get what I’m saying, so it’s nothing where we just, everybody’s just going about their business minding their own business not even looking around their surroundings, not even caring. But yeah, man, sometimes it’s nice to just, you know, get that, from anybody. Literally.

Interviewer:

So, it sounds like what you’re saying is you feel that, you feel that, you feel that you live in a world where everyone’s just doing their own thing, minding their own,

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] literally

Interviewer:

[continues] business.

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

You know, it is what it is, and it’s life. At the end of the day, obviously, if you, if, if it could change it would be a better world but it’s life at the end of the day, people go about their business, people going to work, come back home, feeling miserable, so be it. It is what it is.

Interviewer:

So, sounds like what you’re saying is, because everyone’s doing their own thing, minding their own business, this leads to people feeling lonely.

Interviewee:

Literally. It can. It can. Not possibly but it can, individually, anyway. Depends how you can deal with it.

Interviewer:

Uhum. And when you said that, you know, some people might be walking on the street, not, and not with confidence, and then, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Well, like I said, individually, depends how you deal with it. So, like, me, for example, I don’t, as long, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t care about what I weigh or how I look, as long as I, as long as to me, I’m comfortable enough to walk around. I’m cool, but to someone else, it, like, especially, literally, like, everyday, everyday I walk pass people, people are so worried about ‘how I do look?’ or ‘is what I’m wearing alright?’ or 3:50…can’t make out what it is. How do you feel? You comfortable? Cool.

Interviewer:

Mmm. Mmm. So sounds like what you’re saying is people worry about how they look and how people judge them.

Interviewee:

There you go. About how people judge them or what people think, 4:10 onwards. It’s alright, it’s alright, you individually, it’s about how you feel inside, if you’re comfortable, yeah 4:17. Do what you’re doing.

Interviewer:

Mmm. Mmm. And, how do you think that impact, um, loneliness?

Interviewee:

Because, obviously (or, ‘well, see’) 4:34, if you’re, if you’re walking around with no confidence whatsoever and you’re too busy worrying about how people think and how they see you or how they judge you, you’re gonna go back home feeling sad, 100%, because before you stepped out of your house, you were already worrying about the people out there, so definitely when you’re back home, [5:01] what would the people out there, there’s just you and your loneliness, so. It goes back to what I said – it depends, individually, how people deal with it, so, that’s it.

Interviewer:

Mmm…and when you say, ‘individually, how people deal with it’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Well, some people, some people, some people go home and cry, innit? Crying the tears out. Some people just, I don’t know, get a, get an advisor or something, but, yeah, with me, I just carry on about my life, it’s life, life goes on.

Interviewer:

mmm. So, it sounds like what you’re saying is people can deal with their insecurities in different ways,

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] In different ways.

Interviewer:

[finishing his sentence] For example.

Interviewee:

Individually. It just depends. [5:47- I think I got it correctly but, not sure]

Interviewer:

And, and, and, and, you, so you’re saying that in general, people tend to care a lot about how others view them.

Interviewee:

Yeah…..Yeah. Obviously and how they judge them. Literally.

Interviewer:

And, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

What? People judging them?

Interviewer:

Uhum.

Interviewee:

Um, Yeah, obviously, like, um, see – for example, like, dressing up, as I say, dressing in, in like our parents, should I say, our parents, obviously, if you, dpedning on your aprents, if you walk around worrying about how people are gonna judge you, that’s already putting you off because anybosy can say one thing and you’re already taking it the wrong way because you feel like they judding you. So, that’s, I don’t even know, it’s just, it’s, it’s it’s simple, it’s just, people just, I don’t know, I don’t know, not be too quick to judge, you know?

Interviewer:

Sorry? [loud background noise]

Interviewee:

Not to, not be to be too quick to judge.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

You know? And, and other people as well, other side, not to be worried about other people judging.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

Not everyone’s perfect.

Interviewer:

Mmm. And, how does that make you feel when you see that you know, when you, when you know that people judge too quickly?

Interviewee:

What me, personally? Me, personally, like I said, life goes on. I, I don’t really care, cause I, one thing about me is I do have confidence. There’s loneliness, loneliness has its own meaning but confidence, I have that, so. When it comes to people judging and all of that, I don’t, I don’t[…] [07:51 – 07:58].

Interviewer:

So it sounds like what you’re saying is on the one end, people, um, people are too quick at judging,

Interviewee:

Yeah.

Interviewer:

And on the other hand,

Interviewee:

And the other hand, you’ve got two,

Interviewer:

There’s that that mental worries.

Interviewee:

Worries. About other people judging.

Interviewer:

And, how do you feel about this whole thing?

Interviewee:

Well, first, people need to stop worrying about people judging. And, second, people judging, need to mind their own business. Judge in your mind, don’t judge up [08:24].

Interviewer:

Mmm….so going back to what you said earlier, you put down here [referring to the box],

Interviewee:

Sometimes, just “hi, how you doing” can make a difference.

Interviewer:

Can make a difference, yeah [reflecting what back what the interviewee is saying]. So, yeah, so essentially, what you’re saying, going back to what to what you said earlier that, you know, it seems like, you live in a, we live in a world where, I’m just trying to reflect back what you said, so.

Interviewee:

Yea, I understand.

Interviewer:

We live in a world wherew people are really busy, doing their own thing, and, and that sense of connectedness, even just a ‘hi, how are you?’ is gone.

Interviewee:

Literally. You might, you might, still get it every now and then but if you do you do.

Interviewer:

When you say it’s gone, when you say it’s gone, can you tell me about that?

Interviewee:

Well, same thing – people go about their business, it’s just, it’s just my surrounding, like people, everybody just walking up and down, people going here and there, people go to work, people going home, people going on holiday, whatever, everybody just head down going about their business, like, they don’t know what’s going on.

Interviewer:

Mmm. When you say ‘they don’t know what’s going’, can you tell me more.

Interviewee:

Yeah, like, obviously, you know, they don’t know what’s going with other people around them, they don’t know what any other person is thinking around them, literally.

Interviewer:

And, when you say, like, ‘they don’t know what people around them thinking’, tell me more.

Interviewee:

Um, obviously they don’t necessary have to care, they don’t care obviously. Everybody’s doing their thing innit? But, it’s just simple, you just don’t, you, you never know, innit? You never know. You just never know what the next person around you is thinking. It’s just like that.

Interviewer:

You never know what, sorry?

Interviewee:

You never know what the next person around you is thinking. Literally. And obviously, if you’re too busy in your own world then, to wherever you’re going to, the next person, the, anybody, the next person behind should I say, I don’t know, (10:39) could be doing something different, if we slow down, like, like, for example, I’m coming from work, the next person behind me can possibly be having, finding it difficult to find work. Next person behind that person (11:02 gotta be moving out of his house), you know. Everybody’s gonna go (11:05). It is what it is.

Interviewer:

So, sounds like what you’re saying is, you know, people are very disconnected today.

Interviewee:

Basically. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And, how does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

It is what is it, like I said. I just go about my business too. Like everybody else does. I’m cool with it. It is what it is. It’s all good.

Interviewer:

Um, and is there any else you want to say about box 1?

Interviewee:

Naw, that’s about it.

Interviewer:

OK, thank you. Can we talk about what you’ve put in box 2, please?

Interviewee:

OK. [Smiling] I don’t really want to get into this one too much, innit, this was, this was a personal one, it’s just obviously, I guess everybody goes through it. Maybe not everybody but most people do and it’s just sometimes you start to think so much you start to cry, like, it could be where you are in life, it could be, like, you know what, I expected more, could be reflecting back two years ago where you was and where you are now, and feel like ‘wow, it’s kind of fail (12:20), I kind of fell off and you know, getting emotional, tears come out.

Interviewer:

Ofcourse. And when you said ‘expected more’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Um, I’s just, things could have been better. Can I, can I leave it like that, can I leave it as that? Things could have been better [smiling].

Interviewer:

Just to let you know that everything is gonna be dealt with with the strictest confidentiality, it’s not gonna be, you know, read or anything by somebody else, this is not gonna be said who is who, who did this, who did, who said this, so it’s completely confidential.

Interviewee:

Yeah, no, that’s cool. I just, I just, I don’t want get, I don’t want to get into it too much as well [laughing]. It’s like when you, you know when you go for a setback, obviously you carry yourself up, you move on. I’ve moved on. But obviously when you think about it, you get emotional and, you know, that’s why I don’t wanna talk about it too much, you get it?

Interviewer:

Mmm. [Pause]. Um, and how does that make you feel being in that situation that you basically had a setback, you dealt with it and when you reflect back, you…

Interviewee:

You know what? That’s a good question. I tell you, I tell you something. It, I feel better, it makes me feel stronger because here I am. We’re talking right now. There is people in the worse, I could have been in a worse situation, I could have been in a worse place but I’m here, I’m, I’m, I’m okay. I could say I’m okay, so, yeah. I’m strong and I have a strong, I’m alive, I’m strong.

Interviewer:

Mmm. So, what did you actually write here? ‘Sometimes…’

Interviewee:

Sometimes I start to think so much and I start to cry.

Interviewer:

Mmm. And when you say you think, like…

Interviewee:

Just reminiscing, reflecting. Reflecting, yeah – could be backwards, could be 14:28 positive, could be just thinking about the future.

Interviewer:

When you say ‘thinking about the future’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Oh, yeah, obviously. Expectations innit? I’ve got expectations, obviously I need to, I expect myself to do better. So, that’s where I’m heading right now. That’s what I mean by that.

Interviewer:

So, sounds like, you think about the future, so like, you expect something from yourself.

Interviewee:

Yeah, yeah, definitely. I expect to be in a better place. At least in two years from now. Definitely.

Interviewer:

Mmm. And, um, [referring to the box] is this person you [referring to the participant]?

Interviewee:

No, no, that’s not me, that’s just a picture I just drew. I look better than that picture [laughing].

Interviewer:

Mmm. [Pause], sounds like you might worry also about the future too?

Interviewee:

I wouldn’t say worried, I would say ‘weary’, like, I’m trying to be careful so I don’t make the wrong decisions. Not worried, I’m not worried at all, I’m strong.

Interviewer:

Mmm, seems like you also want to make sure that you, you want to make sure that you know, you’re doing the right thing, you make the right decision so that there’s a “good future”?

Interviewee:

Better future [laughing]. Yeah, definitely. Definitely, definitely. 15:29

Interviewer:

And how do feel about, how do you feel now?

Interviewee:

Now I feel good, now I feel good, um, you know, had, had, had screwed on (16:37), you know, in a better place, it’s just, you need to just stay there and keep up, literally.

Interviewer:

Sounds like, your, your, your, um, earlier life was difficult for you?

Interviewee:

Um, not difficult, cause it could have been worse, but it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright.

Interviewer:

Mmm. When we can move on to the next one, if you like.

Interviewee:

Family [referring to box 3].

Interviewee:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 2?

Interviewer:

Oh, um, naw, naw.

Interviewee:

OK.

Interviewee:

I’m done with box 2.

Interviewer:

Sure. Can we talk about what you’ve put in box 3, please?

Interviewee:

Yeah, um, family. Obviously, being lonely…it says, it says, it speaks for itself, innit? It’s, like, it’s actually the only thing I put there, just ‘family’, cause obviously you need family, I, I, I, for one, I didn’t, didn’t grow up with family like that, so, family is a really really really really big thing, like, it has an effect on everyone, but I don’t feel everyone understands it, I don’t think every parent understands it. People just play about, have their little romance, have a child and just think all is well. I, I, it is what it is.

Interviewer:

Mmm. So, you’re saying that family is important for…

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] everybody. I mean very important. For me…it is very very important.

Interviewer:

And, what makes family important for you?

Interviewee:

You know, having a mom that’s there, growing up. Brother and sister there, growing up. Living in the same house. You know? Having your little dinners and little lunch together and stuff like that. Not everybody sees it like that.

Interviewer:

Mmm. [Pause] How does that make you feel when you feel like? 19:09.

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] Pissed off. Every time I talk about it I get angry. I just get pissed off. [Long pause]. It’s really, it’s really simple. Like, the word family is really simple, you don’t live and you don’t, for example, you don’t even need siblings, just mom, dad, child. If you have siblings, lucky you, if you don’t, it is what it is, you just have your parents there. I mean, obviously some people didn’t have, some people don’t have their chance because maybe their patents passed away or what not, but still it goes back to the family, family is important….to some people, I guess.

Interviewer:

Mmm. And do you think both mom and dad is important or can it be one?

Interviewee:

[Interrupts]. Definitely. Both. If, it it’s one, it is what it is. I’m sure that one person would still have an impact and still try their best but two is good. You know, two is better than one. So, mom and dad, definitely. It’d be nice.

Interviewer:

Mmm. Do you have your own family right now?

Interviewee:

I’ve got, I’ve got a child, yeah. I’ve got ‘chino’ (his name?) 20:54-20:56. That’s my baby. And his mom is gonna (….) 20:58 for him. So, yeah, he’s lucky. But, I wish I could say that for myself. I mean, they’re there but we’re just not together like, we’re just, just, not family. It’s just mom, dad, sad parents, it’s like a family. 21:14 review.

Interviewer:

Hmmm. [Long pause]. Do you have any siblings?

Interviewee:

Yeah. What, you wanna talk about it? No ‘something, something’…. 21:44

Interviewer:

So, sounds like generally speaking, what you’re saying is family is really important to alleviate feelings of loneliness.

Interviewee:

Yeah. Literally.

Interviewer:

Especially mom and dad?

Interviewee:

Yup. Obviously, I’m not, it is what it is, as you can, as you can probably see I’m getting worked up by it, but it’s just, you know it is yea, I don’t even wanna say I’m lonely and what not cause I’m stronger than that but family is important. So, yeah.

Interviewer:

Of course. [pause]. Um, is there anything else you want to say about box 3?

Interviewee:

No, that’s it. Just, family is important. I wished everybody can understand that?

Interviewer:

When you say ‘you wished everybody can understand that’ can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

It’s just, like I said, I said it, I said it earlier, well, it’s just I don’t think everybody understands that because people just, I feel like, people just meet, have their little romance, have a child, and, and then split up and then, so feel like that’s it. And forget about the impact it would actually have or the effect it would have on the kid.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. When you say ‘the impact’, if you feel comfortable, you’re welcome to talk. When you say ‘the impact’, can you tell me more?

Interviewee:

Well, impacts as in, if, if, if they actually considered ‘you know what? It would be best to have that family but so the kid can be all good’… and then effects cause if they actually considered that if we actually split up that would have an effect on the kid.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

But, like I said, I don’t think everybody understands that. It’s that simple.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

Angry. Very angry.

Interviewer:

mmm.

Interviewee:

But you know, I move on. And I got kid now, so you know, he, he’s the best right now, he loves it. So good, so good.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 3?

Interviewee:

No, I’m good.

Interviewer:

OK, thank you. Can we talk about what you’ve put in box 4, please?

Interviewee:

Box 4 I said no jobs, no money, no good home.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

And it’s more or less, I’ve basically spoken it but at one point in my life I didn’t have a job. I tried to get a job but obviously it wasn’t easy. I literally tried. Not because of convictions or any, any problems or anything, it was just not easy. And you know, being at home, no, no, it was just so ridicules. Literally. And how you gonna get money? No money. It’s crazy, you know. I had to, I had to, I had to improvise.

Interviewer:

Mmmm. [Pause]. Sounds like during that time when you didn’t have a job it was very difficult.

Interviewee:

Very, very difficult. Very difficult. Like I said, I had to improvise. It is what it is.

Interviewer:

[Pause]. When you said you had to improvise, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Um, no, I just met a few friends and you know, just kicked back and chill. That’s it.

Interviewer:

And when you said ‘no good home’, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah, like I said I never grew up with my family. When I grew up, I grew up with a different, my last name was different, people that raised me their last name was different. So, not even family, not even, I don’t know, what you call it ‘family friends’, that’s how I grew. So, fun 26:17. And then obviously my sisters are on the other side, it was just, it was just like that. That’s about it.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewee:

But you know, I moved on. I’m alive. I’m alive and strong.

Interviewer:

Mmm. So, yeah, just reflecting back what you said. Having no job, no money, no good home where you feel support can make you, it makes one, you or somebody in general feel lonely.

Interviewee:

Definitely. Definitely. Do you know how many times where I’ve even, even, as it sounds, it sounds like the way I ‘read it’? 27:08 the way it sounds, sounds like obviously no job, no money, no good home. SOUNDS the way it sounds. But, you know how many times I went to the to the council trying to get a little bedroom just to move away from all of that where I was cause no siblings, no family, no mom, it was just ridicules. Everything about it was just ridiculous.

Interviewer:

mmm.

Interviewee:

I was pissed off most of the time. Everybody, anybody would feel lonely with that. Anybody grow up with no folks.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel?

Interviewee:

Well, now? Still pissed off. Like I said I’m alive and strong, I’m cool. Some people don’t, some people can’t, some people don’t even the chance to even to speak right now. At least I can talk. So, yeah. Right now, I feel, I’m okay, I’m all good. [small pause]. Everybody is living their lives, life goes on.

Interviewer:

[small pause]. How did it make you feel back then when you felt like you didn’t have money, you were jobless and you didn’t have a good family.

Interviewee:

Like a bomb \bum 28:29. [laughing]. Like someone you don’t even like, it was so hard and shit. Yeah it was shit. It was really shit. Wake up, no motive. I mean, I don’t, like, don’t get me wrong, I would go out hand out CVs, apply online and stuff, at times even go for interview, you don’t get the job so you apply in next six months so like what the hell is this? Well, that’s their way, innit? Life goes on.

Interviewer:

Mmm.

Interviewer:

When you say you didn’y have any motivation to wake up…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] No, no, no. You wake up and you have no motivations for the day, no motive, no plan, it’s just wake up, 29:38 (I can’t wake out what it is), go back to the something. No where to go. No money in the pocket, back to the same bullshit house, and then you know what? It makes you wanna leave. It makes you just wanna go out there, go somewhere else, you know? Like I said,  I went out there and made a few friends and ‘just kicking something, something’ 29:58.

Interviewer:

So when you said, you made some friends, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Oh yea, that’s just an area? 30:9-10 just you know, step out of the house, just make friends in the neighbourhood, and you can make new friends, that’s about it. Have a little one two drinks, kick back and talk.

Interviewer:

How did that feel?

Interviewee:

I was better cause at least, at least inside, indoors, no job no money, bullshit inside, you feel like you know what, you step up, especially when I set up now and I’m sad, my throat, my friends, cause there is, obviously everyone’s got what they’re all going through, when you step up (or ’step out’ 30:42-43), and you’re feeling a little sad on that, you have one or two friends ask you: “yo, what’s up, what’s wrong with you, what’s what’s what’s going? What do need? “ And you know, you feel better, cause one or two of them kinda help and you know, it’s good. It’s good.

Interviewer:

Sounds like having that support from your friends even if it’s just about ‘hi, how are you?, how how’s it going? Are you okay?’

Interviewee:

[interrupts] Yeah.

Interviewer:

Can make you feel better.

Interviewee:

Definitely. Definitely. Way better.

Interviewer:

Hmm.

Interviewee:

Sometimes, sometimes your friends out there support you more than your family at home, you know that right? [laughing].

Interviewer:

And, how do you feel about that?

Interviewee:

It’s crazy, but it’s good, at least you can get help. It’s good, so I feel good about it. Just at home feeling all miserable, you come out, have a little one two drinks, have a laugh and still get help, still get support, still get asked ‘how you doing?’.

Interviewer:

Sounds like even just having one person or that you know that they care about you…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] Oh, now yea, now I’ve got loads of friends out there. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. As soon as I step out of the neighbourhood, definitely. 100%. People come say hi ‘yo, how you doing?’. It’s really good.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 4?

Interviewee:

Um, apart from, I’m I’m, I’m okay now so, you know, eventually things will get better, you know, and I’ll be in the best place [laughing]. Yeah, that’s about it.

Interviewer:

Anything else?

Interviewee:

No, I’m good.

Interviewer:

Thank you. Now we move on to Part 2 of the study.

Part 2

Interviewer:

Now we are at Part 2 of the study. Um, can we start by talking about what you’ve put in box 1. Thank you.

Interviewee:

I said, you know what, sometimes I feel like I need social media so much that I spend at least 75% of my day on it. I come to barking sometimes after work to see friends around the neighbourhood, to chill and relax and have a couple of drinks. Feel good.

Interviewer:

Hmm…So, when you say that you know you spend time on social media, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah, that’s obviously when you’re at home. I’ve got an iPhone and you know I’ve got Instagram, snap chat and those things and go on Instagram to see what’s going on around the world – seeing pictures and videos and stuff. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And how does that make you feel when you’re on these social media platforms?

Interviewee:

Sometimes I have a laugh cause you see a funny video from some dext 38:18 country and it’s just funny. You can see a, you need to see someone getting chased down by a monkey or something and it’s just funny you know. And that could just be for me just being down all of a sudden and pull out my iPhone and literally just press Instagram and a first thing I see on the newsfeed can just make me laugh. So, yea, literally, I literally spend most of my time on my phone.

Interviewer:

On social media?

Interviewee:

On social media. Literally. Cause I’ve got quite a lot of apps as well so, you know.

Interviewer:

Uhum.

Interviewee:

It’s alright. Plus, it’s nice to be updated. Yeah.

Interviewer:

And, in terms of interacting with your friends, cause social media can be a way to chat with friends, right?

Interviewee:

Yeah, of course.

Interviewer:

Do you engage in sort of, sort of

Interviewee:

Chatting?

Interviewer:

Yeah

Interviewee:

Yeah, of course, of course. I do dating apps too.

Interviewer:

Uhum.

Interviewee:

Yeah. Definitely.

Interviewer:

Sounds like what you’re saying is social media keeps you up to date, keeps, makes you laugh and makes you…

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] makes you socialise and connect with people as well around the world, not just your neighbourhood, anywhere. Literally. It’s good.

Interviewer:

And what did you right at the second bit?

Interviewee:

I come to barking sometimes after work to see friends around the neighbourhood, to chill, relax and have couple of drinks. I feel good.

Interviewer:

Uhumm. So basically, so sounds like what you’re saying is meeting up in the nieghourhood with friends for drinks can make you feel good and socially connected.

Interviewee:

Definitely. After a long day at work, you don’t want to go straight home, especially when the home aint no, aint good, like it’s long, you come here, at least you can relax a bit you know, have a laugh, have a drink, you know, it’s cool.

Interviewer:

Sounds like you like that having a laugh, and just catching up with friends…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] Definitely. I don’t want to be lonely and I don’t to be miserable all the time. Trust me, work is, when you’re at work you can’t be having a laugh especially when your supervisor, manager is on to you. Any little thing that was ‘get back to work’ [the interviewee here is referring to his manager saying ‘get back to work’]. You know. Go there, be professional, finish the work, come out, meet a couple of friends around the neighbourhood and have a good time.

Interviewer:

Uhum. Sounds like that’s your free time that you can really enjoy, yeah.

Interviewee:

Definitely. I mean back then when I never have a job, all I did was to hang around with the friends and chill, you understand what I’m saying?

Interviewer:

Uhum.

Interviewee:

So, now you go to work, be professional, finish it off, come down, kick back, go home and relax.

Interviewer:

Uhum…and when you said you don’t like to be home, this is part 2, so maybe you can, is there anything else you want to say about box 1?

Interviewee:

I drew, I drew, you didn’t ask me about the pictures. The pictures is basically when I say I come around the neighbourhood and, and chill with friends, this is just friends around [laughing].

Interviewer:

Oh nice.

Interviewee:

That’s what, you know what, I’ve written more than drawing cause I obviously I’m not really good at drawing but yeah those are just they’re little friends around [referring to the drawing] chilling.

Interviewer:

Yeah, it looks cool.

Interviewee:

[laughing]

Interviewer:

So, basically, you just, this shows that you like to chill with your friends…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] yeah

Interviewer:

And yea,

Interviewee:

Just having a good time.

Interviewer:

So, yeah, just to, just to summarise what you’re saying, sounds like, you like being connected with people both in person, have a laugh…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] and on social media.

Interviewer:

And on social media, which makes you feel good and connected.

Interviewee:

Yeah, definitely.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 1?

Interviewee:

No that’s about it. It’s all good.

Interviewer:

Um, thank you. Can we talk about box 2 please?

Interviewee:

Alright, I said, um, the place you feel most lonely and I said at work and at home, sometimes. And then I drew a picture as well with just one person, which is supposed to be me, windows there, the bed, and you know that’s about. So yea, obviously, at work, cause you’re being too professional, you’re all professional, you’re lonely because, me, for example, I’m all professional, professional and when I’m at home, on my day-to-day life I’m spending 75% on social media. So you can imagine what I’m like when I’m at work. I’m bored and miserable, I can’t wait to get out [laughing]. And then at home, you’re miserable already because you’re, you’re thinking about how you’re going to go to work and be another miserable person, so both places, you just wanna go out there, and just chill and kick back with a couple of friends, have a drink. Cause then, if you’re miserable, one of them will ask you, ‘yo, what’s wrong? Why are, why are so quiet all of a sudden? Why are you so quiet?

Interviewer:

Uhum.

Interviewee:

And you’d be feud. You’d say it. Like, you know what, this is that, this that or you know what, ‘I just had a long day at work, you know.’ And your friend would be like ‘yo, relax man’. It is what it is, you have to work, if you don’t work, how are you going to get this money? Go and work. Well, at the end of the day you finish work, come and relax, don’t be miserable, don’t go straight home and feel like the day is done. Naw, you come kick back, have a laugh, go home and just rest. You know.

Interviewer:

What is about home that makes you feel lonely?

Interviewee:

You know what? My home, I don’t have TV, I don’t have a play station, if I don’t have a TV, I can’t have a play station, I’ve literally just got a bed and obviously that’s because of personal shit you know but you know it’s still something, but yea very lonely actually. Exactly how the picture is [referring to the drawing he made] just me, a bed and you know, but yeah.

Interviewer:

Sounds like, um, what you’re saying is if you had some sort of entertainment in terms of play station, TV can make you feel…

Interviewee:

[Interrupts] oh yeah, TV at least. I’m not asking for everything but TV at least, yeah.  How do you think I spend most of my time on my phone? I don’t have a choice [laughing].

Interviewer:

When you said that sometimes you’re at home you’re thinking about work, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee:

Yeah, obviously, I work four days a week so and obviously at the same time with my kid I gotta pick him up from school and that what, that’s that. When I’m, the other days of that I get, like for example, today I’m off, tomorrow I gotta go get my son from school again on Tuesday cause it finishes. Wednesday I’m back to work, so my tomorrow when I’m at home I’m already thinking about the next day that I go to work that I gotta go to work so I’m already feeling down like you know what my day off is done already cause I gotta get back to this shit so yeah, that’s that. But you know it’s part of life though, it’s part of life, I’m just saying, when I’m at home I’m thinking of the next day I gotta go into work I’m thinking God damn it 41:45. I want to call in sick [laughing].

Interviewer:

Sounds like what you’re saying is um at home you feel lonely because you don’t have TV, you constantly find yourself thinking about work which you don’t necessary like.

Interviewee:

Yeah, literally. And then you know, you can’t be inside all day. You step out, you meet up with friends and then chill.

Interviewer:

How does that make you feel you don’t, like, how does that make you feel about your job?

Interviewee:

First of all I have to work [laughing]. But you know, as much as I feel like you know what, as much as I feel lonely that I can’t say I’m at work, I have to do it, so it is what it is, it’s life, I just gotta move on with it. So, in terms of how I feel, it’s alright, it’s life, can’t feel another way about it otherwise if I feel so bad about it, I’d say to myself ‘don’t do it’ but I have to do it, I have to work. Maybe you might just, maybe if I could change the job then you know something more entertaining then something more me then maybe yeah…feel alright. But for now, I gotta hold on to that so yeah, it’s alright.

Interviewer:

Sounds like your job doesn’t make you happy.

Interviewee:

No. It’s a warehouse ‘something’ 43:22. Carrying boxes and stuff but you know, its still a job, so yeah.

Interviewer:

It sounds like you don’t have a lot of laughs…

Interviewee:

[interrupts] Nooo, not at work. Not when you’re lifting stuff acting professional and you know. Definitely.

Interviewer:

At work, you don’t necessary have the entertainment that you want, as in play station, TV.

Interviewee:

No, at work you can’t have that.

Interviewer:

No, not at work, I home I mean.

Interviewee:

At home, yeah [laughing]. Yeah, no, I don’t.

Interviewer:

And you find yourself that you’re thinking about ‘oh now that I have to work tomorrow’ and that kind of stuff.

Interviewee:

Yeah, the day is over. Back to the same shit.

Interviewer:

Is there anything else you want to say about box 2?

Interviewee:

Um, I be in a better place soon [laughing].

Interviewer:

And is there anywhere specifically in your home that you feel most lonely?

Interviewee:

No, not really, just the home in general.

Interviewer:

Uhum…..anything else you want to say?

Interviewee:

No, that’s it.

Interviewer:

Thank you.

Interviewee:

It’s alright.
