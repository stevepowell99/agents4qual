Okay, thank you. I'll put this here, so it's closer to you. So, um, can we start by talking about what you've put in the first one, please?

So, in the first one I've put Gomshall, which is where my parents are from and the trains they go once every two hours, so it's like um 4 to 6 and I was, I had such an issue with loneliness at this point, when I was living at their house because all my friends lived very far away and I could only get a train once every two hours. So, I was like completely isolated in the middle of the country for, since I did, I can't even remember when, but a really long time and I've only just got out of that, so that was like really lonely, just like total isolation and a train every two hours doesn't sound that bad, but like if you miss one by a few minutes, that's four hours, you know, so it's just um yeah, that's what that was about.

So basically, you know, not being close to other people...

Yeah, exactly, just like, you're not even having the distance, like when I moved to Hackney Wick, what was like, what brought me so much happiness, which I think people totally take for granted is that I could walk to the shops, because like where I lived with my parents you can't even walk to a shop like and I can't drive, so I couldn't do anything, um, and I think people really take life for granted, like actually having things locally is, is something that like really makes you feel connected to people and like just even seeing people outside walking, just so, brought me so, even still does, it brought me so much happiness.

Okay, and, and when you were in that situation and, um, when you miss trains and so on like how did that make you feel, being in that sort of situation?

Just like totally helpless, because I had no other way of getting around just the train and then the, there were buses in the area but apparently, I never got it because everyone say they would never turn up, um sorry, I forgot what your question was.

You know, just basically like how, how did that make you feel, being in that situation?

Oh yeah, just really helpless, just like there's nothing I could do... at all, um... yeah.

And um, tell me more about the, um, so, if you are, if you let's say, I mean you said that you, basically, every two hours the trains could come essentially, right? And if you missed the other one, that means that you had to wait for another two hours...

Yeah, or because it was cancelled or delayed, so like even if I was getting that first Gomshall train and I was going, you know, to London I'd miss my connecting train, if that one was delayed and then there's nothing you can do or I would miss like hours of college in the morning because the train is delayed and I have no other way of getting there.

Hmm, okay, *pause* and tell me more about the people, sort of within like, and, within that area like, I wondered if you like could talk about like, were there any other people around that area at all?

Where my parents there were, but they were all very like old, retired, white racist people, that's the common people that live like where my mom lives right now, there's no one like my age at all, um, yeah, just no one, um so yeah, just super lonely.

When you said racist, can you tell me more about that?

I was having this conversation earlier as well, um just everyone in that sort of area like not outright racist, not like to the extreme, but lots of just like uneducated responses to things and also lots of homophobic people, just kind of like, just like not educated in a sense... of like how people should, like people to correct, correct when they speak, in those scenario like even thought of like acknowledging other cultures or anything.

And how did that make you feel?

Like completely separated from anyone that I went to college with, anyone that I grew up with, just like, I just felt so like disconnected to everyone around me because I had different views, different, because I, I make art and like just no one did that either, I was just kind of really disassociating to everyone, just like everyone's here and I'm here, kind of thing, like outcasted a lot, like even at dinners and stuff, like I remember after like the Brexit vote and I voted, I voted to remain and everyone else has voted to leave and then I got like, you know, just nasty comments for that, for being like the different one, like for my family and friends and stuff, like not even from, from people I don't know, just like people that are close to me.

People close to you being all so different, can you tell me more about that?

Um, well, the only person that's quite similar to me is my brother, who also lives in Hackney Wick, um but yeah, people close to me like my mom and her boyfriend and my sister, I mean, I'm not really sure about like my sister's political views, but I know my view is very different to my parents, my parents are quite conservative. Yeah, and then also a lot, I mean, I'm really not very clued up politically at all, but neither was anyone else I grew up around, like no one acknowledged it, because it's kind of like... if you're living in London, it didn't apply to you, really, and I was interested probably more so at the time, in politics and things like that, but I had no one to kind of like feed that off, because I had no one to talk to about anything, even my brother who I had the same views as, didn't live at home and then I couldn't speak to my mother about any political views because you know mine wrong, kind of thing. So yeah, just being different to everyone around me... and that being different, anyway, just, just um *pause* yeah, you can't even like talk to people about, about how you're feeling or about your views or anything, she wouldn't want to hear and like, to be honest, I didn't really want to hear other people's as well. So, it's even more disassociating when you can't even communicate properly, because you're just so like, disregard the other persons' views and stuff.

And how did that make you feel?

Hmm... just separate, separate and now, now that I'm a bit older, like one of my flatmates is doing a PhD as well in some sort of politics, I'm sure she's pretty smart, but, but even speaking with her, I feel like it's totally uneducated, just because I feel like I can't even speak, even though I really want to be able to talk to her about these things, but I feel like I can't, because I've never really been given that opportunity, because I was so separated or like not even, not even given the opportunity, when I was younger to even delve into things I could possibly be interested in adult life, because there was just no one to speak to about it. So yeah, separate.

So, not being able to kind of talk about these things or, or speak about things that you might like, kind of had an impact on your loneliness?

Hmm, yeah, definitely, yeah.

Tell me more about that, like today, for like, maybe like relating it to, to now like, if you want to talk to some people about things that you might like or might have a passion for, but if you feel that you're missing the right words, how does that make you feel? Tell me more about that.

*pause* Sorry, could you repeat what you just said, is that ok?

No, I guess, I wondered like, um like, not being able to communicate with someone, does that, I wondered like if that makes you feel like, like if you perceive yourself lower than them and, and I wondered how that made you feel, is that... am I making sense?

Yeah, um well, I guess now I definitely feel lower than people, purely because I feel so uneducated about so many things, that's kind of what this one here is about, in the sense of just like, also, um, I think what has really changed my mindset is living here where I live with 10 people, I'm the youngest, I'm 20, and then the oldest I think is like 33, but because I'm the youngest and everyone else I'm around is older than me, obviously, they're more knowledgeable about a lot more things than I am, it definitely makes me feel like I'm lesser than everyone around me, but, I guess I'm still young and I need time to communicate things, but also, I think, even the people that I do know, my age, actually, I do feel lesser than them in a sense, because, also, talking about communication, as I do art, like I think a lot of people think 'Oh, it's just, you know, make a painting, whatever', but it's really not, like you really have to research artists, you have to be really clued up, there's a lot of essay writing, like so many names to remember and things and when I talk to people my age, who are also doing art, you know, they seem so much more clued up  than I am about artists, like I really struggled last year doing a an art course, I did an art Foundation, because it really like came to light that I was like so much less knowledgeable than all my classmates and I think that's mainly to do with the fact that I grew up in a place where art was like very disrespected and there was no one to talk about art with, because no one cared, you were like the dumb kid if you, you know, did art and things like that so. Yeah, communication is, it has really like actually let me down, to be honest, because it is, it's really like decreased. Like I feel like I could be here, if I was probably given like the same, if I grew up in London and I was around like creative people my whole life, where I wasn't, so, I haven't been able to like feed off other people, feed of the knowledge they have and then feed off my knowledge, it's just been like blank, it's been like stunted. So, I do notice that difference, um which yeah, it kind of does really make me feel just like a lesser and kind of stupid sometimes, but yeah.

Um, so feeling that you might be, you know, less than other people makes you feel lonely.

Yeah, I would say so, I just I feel like I don't fit in, because where I went to school last year, doing the foundation course, it's like the number one in the country, so, you know, it's like a big deal and then everyone there was amazing and I wasn't, and it just like, make me feel, made me feel so out of place, and of course being out of place is definitely lonely, when you feel like you don't fit in, yeah, I think I've struggled with like feeling like I don't fit in for a really long, long time, um but in different things like at schools, of course I didn't fit in because, because I did art and then when I went to Art School, I didn't fit in because I didn't know enough about art, you know, so just depends on the environment that you're placed in, um... yeah.

So, not fitting in or feeling like you're different, or yeah, just generally feeling like you're not fitting into the environment that you're in.

Yeah, exactly, just not being up to the standard of everyone else, um, at art school and that's like definitely because of, I was probably, I mean, I sound like so, I sound really um, like these are very privileged problems I'm talking about but, um, it's just, yeah just being less than everyone at art school, because I probably wasn't given the same opportunities that they had growing up with people that they grew up with in London, as opposed to people in the countryside who, who are just small min-, well from my experience anyway, quite small minded and don't care about issues that I'm, I possibly care about.

So... sorry *allows her to speak*

No, no, you go on.

No, go on.

I wasn't gonna say anything *laughs*

Oh, I was just going to ask, so like not being able to un-, not being able to express, you know, your, your creative skills, not being able to express your beliefs and your passion...

Yeah, exactly, this is like what I have here, a very simple drawing, but um, yeah, I, I, definitely at the moment more than ever I feel like I'm a lesser version of myself completely, because I also haven't been making art for the past year since I stop-, no, I've made a few things but, but I haven't been studying and it's not even about making an artwork, it's about all the research that goes into the artwork prior, before you put the pen to paper or other, all the paintbrush, that kind of thing and I haven't been doing any of that research and I, that makes me feel so disconnected, because whenever someone says to me, especially moving here and everyone being older and they all have their job sorted, people saying to me 'oh, what do you do?' and I just have to go 'ah, I'm a waitress right now' and I just have nothing to say about myself, like at all and I feel, I feel like I'm disconnected from my own self, because I once, a few years ago, when I was at school, I would just be able to talk to you about anything and everything that interested me or be really involved in whatever you're talking about and now, it's just kind of like I have nothing to say for myself, because I've been out of practice and I haven't been focusing my time on things that actually I find really intriguing or interesting or anything because it's just like. Yeah, I don't know, I just need to get working, but um, but yeah that has really made me feel so disconnected from myself, like I've really spent this, the past weekend thinking about it massively, because someone asked me what I do, I just said 'oh, nothing', like I have nothing to say, which is really lonely, because it feels like I'm outside of my own self, I'm not even with me anymore, I'm like a different, different person and that's all through expression, that's all through the fact I just feel like I can't express myself.

So, it seems to me that you are, you're, you are, feeling that you're out of practice, feeling that you can't sort of grow contributes to feeling loneliness and things.

Yeah, exactly, exactly, I mean, like if you're not pushing yourself in any sort of direction, like you're just stunted and that makes you lose touch of yourself totally. Um, yeah, I mean the only like remedy is actually getting my head down and being interested in what I want to do, like it's not a hard thing to get out of, but it also makes me very worried, because I will be studying again at some point and then I'm really worried that when I go back to studying, I will again be the lesser person, the person that doesn't know anything, the person that, just because, obviously, in art you have um, you have critics, so you present your work to your class and you talk about it and people like really criticize you, because art is so subjective and you have to like, I could put, you know, this water bottle on a plinth and be like, that's art and you have to really explain like why, why it would be art, like, like it's okay, that is art, like everything's accepted as an art form, but you have to explain why it's that and just like when you don't, when you can't express truly what you mean, like I'm trying to tell you why I think this is overvaluing in the gallery and I can't express that, that's it, I mean you've failed like your, your module and I have a really hard time like expressing what I'm trying to say with my work, because I have so, like when I make a piece, I've so many different elements going into it, so it's really hard to just kind of like get the words out and then through that, I mean, if you fail and then like obviously you have a whole class of 50 people watching you crumble and burn and then just after that you just feel like you shouldn't even be there, you know, you'll, you're not worthy of being at that place anymore, which yeah, just makes you feel out place, like... unworthy is probably the word.

Thank you, you also mentioned, um, you also mentioned that you know, you, you speak to other people, like they say that they have this job and that and this and that, but then you don't have much to say about yourself, so, it seems that there is that element of social pressure, like... *gets interrupted*

Oh, definitely, especially in this area, in Hackney Wick like there is such, there's a lot of arrogance in this area and like I've always known that, but I've always defended Hackney WIck, I've been like 'oh, no, it's just like, it's great, like everyone is doing their thing here', because it's a very like creative community, um, so, I just go on and I like really try and like get, get rid of the stereotypes around this area, but recently I have actually noticed that the stereotypes are there for a reason, like there's a lot of people who like, I've been to parties and stuff and people go 'oh, what do you do?' and I say 'oh. I work at this Cafe' and it's like a little crappy, so everyone knows it and there's also a gallery space as well, but when I say that and they go 'oh, that's all you do', and it's just like, there's such a pressure to be this, this person that's doing this and that and this and that and then I ask them like what they do and they're just going on and on and on and on and on and I feel like people are just out to get you a lot of the time, I've never felt that way ever, until very recently, people are just out to tear you down, um people I've met recently, which is such a shame, because like, I don't know why we can't all just be like supportive, but um, but yeah people just tearing you down and it just makes you feel, just like and I'm sure and all the time I want to say to these people, I just want to be like, because they're all at least 25 and I just want to say 'I'm 20 years old, like give me a break, like when you were 20 you were probably still living with your parents, you hadn't moved out, you're doing whatever, like I've moved out, I'm supporting myself, doing all these things', but still people are just like, totally disregard you, if you haven't got like some fantastic job or or not even a job, it's not even about being, having paid work, it's about like knowing what you're into, because a lot of people around here make music, so, and I don't really know much about music, like I'm really bad with genres and I just don't know a lot about music pretty much and, and it's just all so hard to communicate, when you don't know about that thing, but um, I kind of lost where I was, um...

Don't worry.

But, yeah, people are just, like they want you to be on the same level that they are, like they're so into whatever music they're making, they know, obviously, it's all like, they know  every, all this stuff that I don't know about and they want you to be on that level with them and I can, if we really got into a conversation about what, about like, if we bring a piece of my work and I would talk about it for a while, like I could tell you like everything about it, but I'm not the type of person to just meet you at a party and just sit there and like talk about why I make this and that, um, I'd rather, you know, be in like an environment, like in my room with someone that I know and then I can like fully explain myself, but I feel like there's a lot of people, who just really quickly want to like tell you what they're about, like as soon as they meet you and I can't, I find that really difficult to express myself in a short like snappy sort of way, which is what a lot of people expect of you now, I think so, yeah, it definitely makes me feel like I just come across to people as nothing and like I'm just someone they might have, might as well have not met because, because I have nothing to offer them in their conversation, like why would I even be part of your conversation if I'm bringing nothing to the table? Yeah.

How does that make you feel?

Just, um, totally vacant like, this is only at the moment, I'm sounding like very depressed, but yeah, it's only at the moment, like this weekend has really been like such a realization for me, when someone asked me like what do you do and I just said nothing and I realized 'wow, I've said that to so many people now', just because I have nothing to say and it's just this limbo part, me working in a cafe, like I have done a lot of creative work throughout the year, but it's just like, right now, all I'm doing is working at the cafe but, um yeah, definitely makes you feel lesser and like you don't even have a reason to be alive, like if you're not doing anything exciting, if you're not bringing anything to the community, if you're not helping someone in some way or doing something charitable like, what is your point of being alive? You're just taking up space, yeah, that's how I feel a little bit.

Thanks for sharing. Okay, is there anything, you want to say more about that box?

No, because that's just one box *laughs*

*laughs along* Thank you. By the way, did you want to close the door?

Yeah, we could do, if you want.

It's up to you.

Yeah, I don't mind.

Do you want me to close it?

Yeah, maybe, if that's okay, thank you so much, it's a difficult room to manoeuvre around.

Not at all, it's really cool actually. I think it's a really cool room.

Thank you, I did it all myself, lots of painting

Very creative, definitely looks like a creative person's room. Um... okay, can we talk about what you've put in the second box?

I feel like all my boxes are quite interlinking, but um...

That's alright.

Yeah, that one again is, is probably most to do with this one, it's, so I mean my parents live on this massive hill and it's just me by myself and like everyone else I know just really far distance, so it's not even just like a mental distance, it's actually the distance, we're really far, like when I was at college all my friends lived in this little town called 'Hazel Mead', which is kind of what that's about as well, as like I'd always see pictures of them at the pub, because there's a lot of like pub culture where my parents are from, like a lot of pub culture because there's nothing else to do, you know, you just sit at the pub and drink and then you go, right, that's it, that's like everyone's motive for every night and yeah, they would do that every single night and I'm just, you know sitting at home, because I couldn't get there, because of the trains, because I couldn't get back, because the last train is at like 11 and um it's a far distance, so, you have to take all the connecting trains, anyway, there's just no way of me like getting anyway, even if, even if I could get a train there, I couldn't get back or something, so yeah, everyone is really far away. Also, something I say to people quite a lot about like a distance thing, I think people never realize is that distance can like, it can get you in some really, well I've experienced anyway, some like really strange relationships with people, because if I can't get a train home, it means I have to stay at someone's house and if you stay at someone's house, they expect something of you in return, so there's a lot of that, um, kind of thing. So, I've been in some like really strange situations, purely because I can't get a train home, which, and that's another thing about loneliness, as I remember, I, so 'Hazel Mead', this town I'm talking about is, there's a guy there called Louis and I would go to the Pub and then I have no way of getting home, so I stay at his after and I made friends with all his friends and it was great, so we'd all get to his house after and I'd stay the night and stuff and it was like, and I started kissing him or like whatever, being in that sort of like romantic thing with him, even though I wasn't interested in him at all, I was literally just staying the night at his house, it just kind of went that way and I made friends with all his friends but the second I, I told him like I don't want to be kissing you anymore, that was it, because I couldn't stay at his house, so I lost out on all these friends and I only had these friends, because I was staying at someone's house, because I wasn't involved in that area, because I was so distant, I couldn't even see these people that I really liked and wanted to hang out with, I couldn't because my only reason for being around them was because I was staying at this guy's house, it's just like, yeah, so distance like plays like a massive part in loneliness and not even just being able to get somewhere, it's like all the other things that surround it, is like yeah, just getting yourself involved in like, with weird situations, because you can't go anywhere, but yes, that was, that's always been quite difficult or I've had like times where I feel lonely and like and like wonder who your real friends are, because I'd come to London to see people and stuff and then they cancel on me, and I'd be like, I'd just be roaming around like central for hours, just like trying to text a friend and be like 'hey, you around?', because I can't get home or like I traveled all the way to London to see someone then they canceled and then I just have nothing to do. So, so, um really makes me question like who, who actually values your time and your energy to like come all the way to see them and then just like not, is this, is this okay what I'm talking about? Is that fine?

Yeah, absolutely, definitely.

Okay. Um... yeah, so... yeah, I really think distance is like the main thing that has always made me feel so disconnected to, to everyone, I moved, so after my course last year, I did the course in Kingston, so I was there, living there for a year and then I came back to my parents over summer and it just like all, I feel like the second I go, go back to my parents’ house, I like fall into this like depression, which is so m-, of so many things, like I was talking about the whole racist, homophobic stuff, like I just don't fit in there and I'm trapped in like, they live in like this massive mansion, so it's, it's like they're in one section of the house and I'm all by myself in the other, so I'd go like two weeks and just seeing my mom, you know, every now and again and it's not even like a closed house, I probably would prefer it less if they were like in the room next door, but um yeah, no that's been such a struggle and when I went back there, it was just like agony, because I'd, because at college I didn't fit in, so didn't really matter that I wasn't seeing people, because I was lonely then, like I didn't actually have contact with people, I was in loneliness, but then when I went to Kingston and I made like true friends, people that I love, people that like really make me feel like being alive and then I was just far away from them, like the distance was like such an issue then, because these people actually really wanted to be around and I couldn't do that, so that's why I moved here, because I was like, I just can't not be, I can't not be in a place that have people walking down the street anymore, um and like not being able to see anyone that like brings me like a slice with joy and I, there was no reason for me to stay at home, because I can't get creative work at home, there's nothing, there's, there's nothing in Guildford, like there's no creative work you could even do, you have to come to London, all my friends are here, it was just like, there was no reason for me to be at home, because there was just no place for me, like I was just like... nothing, all I could do was go and work like in a shoe shop, that's it and that's not getting me anywhere, that's not pushing me and that's going to make you feel more disassociated from yourself in the long run, if you're not actually doing anything that makes you feel involved with other people or makes you feel involved with yourself, so yeah, I just had to leave, um...Yeah.

So um, so just going back to the time that you were st-, you stayed, you'd stay at your, at that guy's house and you have all the friends at, of his, and you basically did make friends with them, but you weren't able to keep those friendships, because you weren't living in the same, you weren't there, involved in their, you know, life and interactions, day today and so on, how did that make you feel?

Oh just like, I've had that quite a lot, I think, like not that I can like fully remember every time now, but that time really sticks out, um, but it just makes you feel like, like no one actually... cares, if you're there or not, actually my brother in his place has a little sign on the door as you walk out that makes me just feel so shit every time I look at it and it says 'no one cares if you go to the party or not', and every time I read that it makes me so sad, but it's actually in, I guess it kind of works for what I'm talking about right now, like I could have been anyone, I could have been any girl, like no one, no one cared about like who I was or what I represented, it was just kind of like there's another person in the group, that's cool, that's fine, she's fun to be around, but you know, there's another girl next week to replace me, like I'm just no one, I'm just like another person and I always, I've always felt like my whole entire life like I, actually up until quite recently, I always have valued my friendship with someone more than they valued it with me, every time, because, because I was feeling so separated and so lonely the entire time, anyone I did make friends with, it was like I'm, I sucked kind of the life out of them, they were my nourishment, they were, they were, they were my only friends really, like this is, again, the boy thing is, when I was 14 I got in my first relationship for about two years and then I was like, you know, with another guy, another guy and the reason I was constantly dating all these guys or being involved with all these guys romantically was because I had no one else to talk to, at any point, so I just like relied on the romantic connections to, as my only form of connection because, because I didn't have any friends and then also, sorry I feel like I'm going off track.

No, no.

Also when I was younger, from like year three to year eleven, I went to an all-girls catholic school, so, I'm sure you can imagine how like homophobic that was and it was just like, I had no friends, like I despised everyone there, it was just like brutal, brutal all girls school, kind of antics, so, um, yeah to, to get rid of that, I just like got a boyfriend at 14 and just kind of rolled with that and then we broke up and I was like devastated and I just hopped on to the next guy, who I didn't even, who I wasn't even interested, I didn't even like his personality, I was just doing it because I had no one else, so yeah, I mean, I think loneliness is, makes you, makes you depend on the people that are around you so much more and I am in a relationship right now, but when I first moved to Hackney Wick, like I knew him long before that, but when I first and I was romantically involved with him before moving here, but then things ended and when I came to Hackney Wick, I'd been here for a few weeks and for the first time that I've ever felt, I totally felt like I didn't need anyone, like didn't need anyone romantically and I think just seeing people outside walking did that for me, like literally, just having, like seeing someone having any sort of interaction, interacting with any person, made me feel like I no longer need a relationship and it has really, really benefited my relationship now, because I feel like if we were to break up tomorrow, I would be like 'okay great, I've loved you for this amount of time and now this is over, let's, let's move on with our lives', but before I was like, I actually didn't know what to do with myself at all, because, because I had no one to talk to about the, about these things going on like with my last relationship, before if I was in a fight with my boyfriend or some kind of argument I, I just didn't know what to do, because I had no one to talk to about it, the only person I had was him and you can't talk to, you know, your partner about how you're like, how you talk to a friend like, it's just like a totally different dynamic. So, yeah, that's really lonely, when you don't have anyone to like talk to about your issues. But yeah, so I mean literally just being around people that walk down the street has benefited how I communicate with my boyfriend, someone I obviously really care about, massively, just um, totally makes me feel so much more secure in myself now and yeah, like we, I think it's this, this relationship that I'm in right now is like the most calm, calm relationship I've been in, there's no arguments, there's nothing and I think a massive part of that is just me being able to talk to other people as I want and when I need to, um yeah. Hmm... what else? Yeah.

Thank you, so, it seems like, so it seems like not having people around you, not even having, not even seeing people around you, just random people walking on the street or just maybe interacting with like a shopper or just not have, not seeing anyone around you could contribute to loneliness and that would impact your relationship and so on...

Massively, like it impacted every friendship I had, I was so frustrated living, living with my mum and that's what this one's also about as well, sorry can I talk about it?

Yes, of course, of course.

It's that yeah, all my friends live in Hazel Mead, all I'd see on Instagram or whatever was like videos of them at the pub and I was like 'I am trapped here and you guys are just like living your freedom'; they weren't living their freedom like I am now, like they can't, they can barely walk anywhere or anything, but just like knowing that they were together and I was just like trapped at home with no nobody, like even if these were the people that, that I did love at the time, like who were my friends at the time and them just, like they, because they knew that I couldn't get anywhere, so it meant they didn't even invite me, they didn't even like consider that I would want to come, so that contributes to loneliness, people just knowing that you can't even get anywhere, it's like 'what's the point in even asking if you can't be there?'

How did that make you feel, seeing your friends on Instagram, you know, together at the pub and you being at home, for example?

Um... just, just really like separate, again, also this is the time when we were doing like our A levels and I was taking all coursework subject, so, you know, I had a lot on my plate, so like after a day and if I didn't like have, have stuff to do that night, you know, it's like desperation to leave the house, it's not like you want to like relax because all I did in the house was work, work, work, work every night, so I mean, I know it was just A levels and you are doing a PhD, so it's like nothing but, but I mean, it's all relative at the time, but yeah, no, it was just um, all I wanted to do was just leave the house and I didn't even have that option, because I can, because there's no one around, there's nothing to do like and there were pubs in my area but you know, you'd go down there and it would be like four old, white guys just staring at you in the bar like, that's it, but yeah, I've always, I've always felt that everywhere, I mean, I haven't travelled around England a lot, but like from the past I have seen, I feel like everywhere is just pretty neglected other than the cities and just yeah, I mean, I just can't understand the appeal of not living in a city, it just like baffles me, like country life is just like another world from what I've experienced, just like the people and... people in the day-to-day life are just doing absolutely nothing, like, when I retire like, they will have, like I want to be living my life, I want to be having fun, doing the things I've always wanted to do and you know, even if you are too old to do things, you want to do just like still have a social life and interact with just like, I just can't understand like the appeal of just sitting at home and just like doing nothing, like I really kind of disagree with my mom's way of living at the moment because um, she has a boyfriend, who was in prison for quite a long time, so after my, my parents divorced she got together with her boyfriend and then he went away for a long time and then he came back and then straight after he came back, just changed like how we were living completely, she was you know, she was out all the time, she had loads of friends, she had, she was living in London her whole life and then moved down to the country like before, just before I was born, but then moved like further into the country once, once her new boyfriend was around and I think he's really pushed this sort of life onto her of just, you know, being at home and eating the whole time, like he's a massive feeder, but, um, yeah, and I just, it's really caused problems with me and my mom's relationship, because I just can't, can't possibly understand how she's gone from this like super social person, having loads of friends to now just living in like the pit of loneliness, in this massive house, where she hasn't even got any friends in the area, she doesn't really see her friends anymore, it's just like, I just can't understand how in the space of five years you've totally changed who you are, completely, but my mom, she doesn't seem to be lonely at all, I think, I think she quite enjoys the life she has, she just got a dog, so I guess she's not as lonely anymore. But um, yeah, it's just, it just, I just can't like understand it, going from, like my mom and my father were, were like really creative people, in like magazines, they had loads of friends, loads of connections and stuff and now to go from that to where she is now, like... I don't know, just, just baffles me a little bit. Um... *pause*

Thank you and seeing your mom changing, you know, through that space of five years being sociable and now like being fully at home and stuff, how does that make you feel?

It makes me feel like I have, God, I'm really sorry, I want to talk to you about it, but I sound like I'm, I'm really problematic, but...

Not at all.

But, it makes me feel like I've been at a disadvantage of what my brother and sister have experienced in their youth, over fun, mum that lets them kind of do what they want, be with their friends, whatever, now for me, it's just like, also because I'm the youngest, there's obviously that whole thing of her being more protective, because she wants to like keep her baby or whatever, but it's yeah, it's just like, I've grown up with a different mother than they have, um like I'm, I'm so much more privileged than my brother and sister, because now, I mean when my brother and sister were growing up, we were, my mother wasn't in the financial place that she is now, so like I'm more privileged in that aspect of like having things or going on holiday or staying in a nice house, whatever I want, so my sister's always like 'oh, you have all this stuff that we didn't have, but I would much rather grow up without all the superficial sort of nonsense and have like a mum that's around, as opposed to being with her boyfriend the entire time and just like, more fun and have people over and just like actually be excited to see people rather than, when people come around to the house or someone's coming up the drive and she's like 'who is that, like who is, who's coming to our house at this hour?' or 'why am I getting a phone call?' Like I, it's just like, she's just like really stressed out about like all the phone calls and stuff she gets and I'm just like, I would much rather have a mom that's like chilled out and, and sees people and has fun and, and I get to see all my family, friends and stuff, rather than living in a nice house with nice cars, because it, like that stuff means nothing to me, I want relation, like this is, what I've always said to my friends, as well, is that like having a nice house and nice cars and all these things like, people ask me why, why I've moved here, as opposed to being in like my mom's fancy house and it's like I couldn't care less about living in a fancy house, nice cars, a personal assistant, like all this stuff, I couldn't care less about it, all I want is like seeing people on the street and having a connection with people like, like that stuff actually makes you live, that stuff actually makes you breathe and like, like those things like make me want to be alive, I don't care about a fucking car that I can't drive, like, like why does it matter? Like who cares about that? It's just, yeah and my mom says the same too 'oh, wouldn't you rather be at home?' when, when we came here for the first time, she saw this place, she was like, it did look quite different here, when she first came, but she was like 'I can't believe you're moving here, how could you do this to yourself?' And I'm like, I just need it, like this is actually air in my lungs or the polluted air in London, it's like so much better than the countryside air, with nothing, you know, it's just yeah, I just love it here and I just went back home last weekend and even, I was just so frustrated, so frustrated like, for example, I did, am I going off topic?

No, no, no.

For example, we went out for dinner one night, because we didn't have any food in the house, we just went to a really, like the closest restaurant to my house, so it was my mom, Stephen, her boyfriend, my mom's like PA, who kind of lives in our house, who she can't, she speaks English, but she doesn't really speak a lot and then there's me, so she's just dead quiet, I'm there and then they're just talking, he has his phone with like a picture of some kind of boat like 'I think I'm gonna buy this boat' and I'm just sitting there and the waiter comes over with all the food and they're like 'Oh, so who is this for?' and they just don't even look at him and they just, don't even acknowledge him, they're just staring at like the picture of the boat on the phone and it just made me feel so frustrated, like I just can't believe you don't have the, the respect or like the, the two seconds to just look at someone and be like 'oh, thank you, yes, that's mine', like why is this stupid boat on your phone more important than a person standing next to you? I just, it just blows my mind.

It seems like you're not really like, um, you don't care about like material stuff as much as, you know, you, it seems like you prefer more emotional things and...

Yeah for sure, like I could, I mean obviously everyone likes nice things, like whatever, like to a certain extent, but I, but yeah, like I said, like I would give up a nice house, a nice bed, all these very lovely privileged things in a heartbeat to just be able to have a conversation with someone, like what's the point in human existence if you can't even speak to a person standing next to you? I just don't get it.

How, how are you feeling about like, um, how did that make you feel when you were sitting at that dinner and, and your family talking about, your mom and her boyfriend talking about, you know, the boat and things?

I just got really frustrated and I can't ever really say anything in these situations, I just, I literally just had this conversation with someone earlier, which is funny, but yeah, I mean, I can't ever say anything in these situations, because my mom and her boyfriend, since he came out of prison, because you come out of prison, you don't just like come out of prison. it's you come out of prison for a few hours, you come out for like half a day, finally you're allowed to spend, spend the night, you don't just like come out, it's like instalments and every single time he would come, it was like my mom would go to the shops and buy everything he liked, it was an event, like every single, like kind of as it would be if you haven't seen anyone for ages and you start seeing them, you want everything to be perfect, it's kind of like that's never worn off, like throughout the years that's never worn off and I have caused so many issues in their relationship by like, as any kind of teenager would, just like talking back or like, but now it's come to a point where I can't voice anything that I feel because it causes a problem in their relationship, so I just kind of have to sit back and ignore all of it, even though like inside I'm so frustrated, but I said, I said when we were at dinner, I was like, I was like 'guys, seriously' because his arm was on the table as well and the guy was trying to put down the food and I was just like 'why are you so unaware of like your surroundings right now?' But um yeah, so I just said like 'guys, seriously, like there's someone right here' and they were like and they would just took issue with whatever I said, as they naturally would, and just like 'oh, we're not being rude, we're not being rude, bla bla bla', and then I got up to like go get some pepper and they were like 'and that's rude, that's really rude of you, he should be doing your pepper for you and you shouldn't be getting up and doing it' and I was like, anyway, so they just and then my mom like often will pull me to the side like afterwards and she'll be like or she'll send me a text, she sends me a lot of aggressive texts *says laughing* being like 'Kitty, you cannot speak this way, you're causing such problems in my relationship, you don't even realize that the issues we have because of you' and stuff like that, so it's just come out, I just really have to sit back and just let them like, do what they got to do, because if I voice anything, I know the effect it will have, because then, because then I'll argue, and it will be my fault... and yeah.

How does that make you feel?

Just um, just like I have no place in my, not exactly my own household, but essentially like my own household, yeah, like I have no place and no value and I'm just like a total interruption and, and yeah, I'm just, I'm just a disturbance to like their relationship a lot of the time, yeah, but um *pause*  Yeah, that's it, yeah, I don't really know what else to say.

It seems like you, it seems like um, it's them against you, not against, but it's like them and then you're here, so you feel, it seems like that you're not, not accepted as much, or you can't express yourself.

Yeah, no, I can't express myself, it's just kind of, it's just kind of like I shouldn't even open my mouth because whatever I'm going to say is probably going to like cause some kind of fight between them, but now that I'm talking about it, it really just sound like the whole, just like any kind of teenager rebellion thing, but it's just um, yeah, I mean, I definitely feel it to like a whole other extent and, and yeah, and, then again like relating it to loneliness like my boyfriend as well has like gone his whole life with just his mother and she's very spiritual, she's very, very much about well-being, very much about connecting and speaking and conversation and all those things, she's just like a power woman on everything and like he's gone his whole life, this is the conversation I said I was having earlier, he's gone his whole life like being really open and accepting and stuff and then he can't relate to me, like whatsoever, like talking about these issues that I have not been able to speak up or anything, which, and the fact the, I mean a lot of my friends also can't, I feel like can't relate to that, because a lot of my friends' parents are like very liberal or whatever and then like I come from like a quite conservative family, so it's just, that makes it hard to relate with people as well, which I guess contributes to loneliness, because I feel like people just don't really understand like what I'm talking about sometimes, because my boyfriend would be like, to me like, 'just stand your ground, like just like, like say how you feel and stuff' and I'm like 'you just don't get it, like I can't, it's just, it's like, there's no point, I just might as well just shut up'. Um... yeah.

It seems like people don't, it seems like people may not, don't, don't understand you, you feel misunderstood or you feel that people don't get you, your friends, your boyfriend.

I mean, I think they, I think people get me, it's just more like, in what I'm talking about now, it's not, I don't generally feel like people don't understand me anymore, I definitely did before, but not so much now, it's just kind of, it's just kind of in situations like this, like it's purely because I was literally just having this exact conversation about my parents at dinner the other day with my boyfriend, we were just talking about this, so yeah, I mean it was, it's purely that he just can't get it, because he's grown up with like a mother who was just so all about her kids, like she, like she's a single mom and so was my mom for a long time, but, and yeah, she's like totally about her kids, like everything's about connection and understanding, being the best person you can be, but for me, it's kind of been like, when I was younger if I was really upset about something, like I remember one time I was like calming myself, because I was so upset about not fitting in and all those kind of teenagerly thoughts that you have, and I just remember her being like 'just grow up', but that was it, there's no like loving, nurturing response, that was just like 'grow up, get over it', kind of thing, just because I haven't ever really had any experiences with my mother where like we actually talk about something that hurts to speak about, so it's just kind of like foreign, like we don't like, also my brother, my whole time growing up, it's always been grow a pair, like it's always been grow up or grow a pair, it's just like 'man up', like stop being such a little bitchy child, kind of thing, so I've never really had that outlet like some other people have of like actually being able to talk about your emotions, until now.

How does that make you feel?

Hmm... I think it's really affected how I can, obviously, right now, I think it's easy to talk to you, because I don't know you, so this is kind of like an informative thing, so it's fine, but like when I'm talking to someone about these things, I guess, it really affected like, even right now, I feel like, I feel like I'm about to cry and I just feel like...

Feel free to cry, if you need to.

But it's just kind of like, whenever I speak to anyone about these things, it's just kind of like I don't even know how to handle my emotions and then yeah, like, it's pretty weird, like when I talk to, because I don't really have much relationship with my dad, when I do speak to my dad, I also have it so much with my brother, it's like my voice is like choked up, when I speak to them, because it's like everything I say... okay, I'm gonna just go back a little bit, so, basically, another thing I had like growing up my entire life, because I'm so much younger than my siblings, so I remember I used to collect these toys called Webkinz and they have like a little code and you can play with them online and that's what I did, like as a kid I just remember doing that, that's not all I did, but I just remember doing that and then we sit at dinner and we would talk, my mum would be like 'okay, so, what did you do with your day?', and I'll be like, 'Oh, so like I played Webkinz today' and my brother would just be like 'Shut up, no one cares' and I had that every, every single meal I ever had, every time I ever spoke, because like obviously my brother and sister were doing like their school work, whatever they were doing, like important, more important stuff than I was, at the time, so it's just always been like 'Oh, shut up, no one cares like about what you're trying to talk about', and I've always had that, so now I'm at the point where I talk to my brother, anything I say is like, you know, before, you know, if you're ever in a massive Auditorium of people and you put your hand up, it's like that feeling of like 'oh my God, I'm about to speak in front of all these people', when it's just my brother, so I have that and I think, because my brother and sister are older than me, because they're quite, they're two years apart and I'm like 6 years from my older sister and then eight years from my brother,  that has made me feel really lonely, because I was an only child because they, they like, my brother went traveling and then they started, then they had University at the same time, so they went and then I was like an only child from then onwards, so from when they were like my age pretty much onwards, so for the last like eight years probably, I feel like I've been like an only child and then that was like at the same time when my mom's boyfriend was coming out of prison, so it's just kind of like, I felt very alone like in a family aspect as well, because I had no siblings around and then my mother was like totally involved with her boyfriend, um so yeah, just me... God, I've really gone, gone off track.

No, no, it's okay. Thank you.

Yeah? Okay.

Is there anything else you want to say about... I don't know if you've kind of talked about this one or this.

Yeah, I feel like I've talked about that one, that's about like being disassociated from my work, so I just haven't been practicing, so it makes me confused about like who, because if you do art like, I don't know, if you maybe are a journalist, actually, maybe not a journalist, but say if you're like a plumber or you just have like some random job, you don't define yourself as a plumber, I feel, I feel like you define yourself as all the other things and then your work, you're a plumber, but when you're like a creative or a paint, like I'm a painter, um saying you're an artist, it's not even about like if you're, because it's not at a point when, when you're, like art isn't your income, it's not your job, you're an artist, that's your lifestyle, it's more of a lifestyle thing as opposed to like a work thing, if people are making money with it, that's great, but it's like you define yourself as an artist and if I'm out of practice, like what am I? Because I'm not an artist anymore, because I'm, because I feel like I can't define myself as something that I'm not practicing, so it's like a tot-, it's a total, um, I mean, I feel like I'm in an identity crisis at the moment, because I can't define myself as anything, because I'm so disassociated with what my, who I am, what my views are, what I want to create, what am I about, what I represent, became so distant from somewhere where I feel like I, when I was like 18, so super young, I knew exactly who I was and what I was about and now it's kind of like, I've no idea, I just can't even speak to you about the things that interest me, because I just feel like, I feel like, I just don't want to open up to people about these kind of things, because, because I've gotten a mindset of being like I don't care who you, because I've met so many people who were so all about themselves recently, like I said, and I'm like, I don't want to come across as that, one, so I don't want to speak about these things and then two I just, I can't... actually, probably one I can't and then two even if I can, I just don't want to come across as like I'm all this *snaps her fingers* I'm all that, check me out I'm this person, because that's, that's not, I don't feel comfortable with that, so I just feel like I'm nobody to anyone, because yeah, I mean, I guess that everyone has a different version of someone in their head, like you're a different person to each person you meet, but just right now like it's fine with everyone that I've met prior to this, it's fine, but right now when, when someone asked me at the moment, I just feel like I'm nobody, because I don't have any sense of worth, because I have nothing to tell them about me, which I mean saying it sounds really like, I don't know the word for it, but it sounds like really, it sounds like... I can't even describe it, it sounds like I really, really care about like being someone and it's not even that, it's like, it's not even being someone that I care about, is like actually being able to speak about, about what I represent, rather than just like say nothing, even if it was just a few words like or just like a little conversation, I'd rather that, and just people know, know nothing about me, because I'm, actually I'm a really open person, like I'm quite happy to talk about, like the things I've just spoken to you about, really, with people that I've met like, like my flatmates and stuff I could talk about it, nothing's really like that private but, but, but, um, but yeah, at the same time, I don't really want to give like everything away, all at once, is this okay?

It's good, it's good. Thank you and how do you feel about that?

*pause* I don't know, it just makes, yeah I just feel separate, that's it, just separate, because I just yeah, kind of like what I've just been saying, I just don't have any like reason for being right now, because I'm not contributing anything to anyone, so what's the point in like being alive? Because I'm not doing anything to, for anything or anyone like no one's ben-, benefiting from me right now, I mean possibly like my flatmates are benefiting from like my presence or like being able to talk to me, but I feel like I'm not actually giving them anything, but that's and that is because I am disconnected from who I am, because of all of these other things, which affect the way I could communicate with even like my flatmates, because I'm just, I'm finding it, I just find it really difficult. Anyway, is it okay if I possibly go to the bathroom?

Of course, yeah, thank you. Did you want to say anything else or should I...

No, no, that's fine.

Okay, cool, that was really great, thank you so much.

Okay, thank you. So, can we talk about what you've put in box one, please?

So, the beach it's, in Hackney Wick it's um, it's about a 34-minute walk away and it's just by the canal, so, obviously, Hackney Wick is by the canal, but you just cross over this bridge here and you're right at the canal, there's loads and loads of boats and then there's just this, it has like these like quite like touristy people, who don't, who aren't really from the area, like these two boats, one that like has ice creams and I'm sure probably drinks and stuff and then one is, um one's like a bar, they're like boat bars, so they're like trendy things, but then just past that, so there's loads of people in that area, anyway, just sitting on the bank and then just passed that is like where the local people kind of sit and people call it the beach, I only found out recently, um and just like, I love that spot because when it's sunny, straight away when I wake up and the sun is shining through there, I just like, instantly, I need to get out the house, because I'm not wasting a British sunny day, that's just not happening and if I have no one to see or anything, you just go down to the bank and sometimes down to the beach and sometimes I go alone, sometimes I go with flatmates, but like whenever you go there you meet people, or you see someone you know, but like a lot of the time, like I've met so many people there, you know, you just sit and then you just talk to people next to you for like, yeah, it's just like, it's just nice and the last time I went, there were just these two, I just asked a guy for a lighter next to me and then I sat with them and we like chilled and I looked after their stuff when they went to go find food and things and it's just, it's just like, I just love that, just like, even if I don't get their contact details or anything like afterwards, I just love like just having that interaction, having the option of like actually speaking to someone next to you, because there is someone sitting next to you, or because, obviously, I work, I work in the area too and Hackney Wick is like an interesting place, because it's one of the few places in London that's like actually very community-based, because if you live and work here, you know everyone, like I barely know, I barely know anyone like compared to like how my flatmate Farah knows everyone, she knows everyone, but I think there's like a really big French Community here as well, so she met a lot of French Community, but um, but yeah, it's just lovely to sit there in the sun and people just, and also it's, it's my route to work as well, so, you walk along the canal, there's loads of people commuting, just walking along, there's just like so many people just walking and then there's um, so you can just, I just love people watching, I just love to watch everyone pass by and then recently I've got really into, I've spoken to a few people about this and it's a bit sort of creepy, but I've got really into like watching young family, so like and this is something, I don't think I could live anywhere now where couples aren't having children, because it just, it makes me feel so alive, like I watched this one couple, like when it was sunny bank holiday weekend, like a few months ago, whenever it was, and the guy was like in this gray t-shirt and like green board shorts and the lady was in like these navy blue, like very straight trousers, looking very 70s, orange and yellow striped shirt and they have like a newborn baby and she's just sat with the baby kind of how I'm sitting and he was sat behind her. They were just cradling the baby and then you know, they were having a lovely time with the baby, then she starts breastfeeding and then their friends come and they were all drinking like Bloody Mary's and stuff, but it was just like so wholesome and I really think that like living in an area where there's new life is so like rewarding for me, and in some kind of way like it just makes me feel like, it just makes me feel so happy, I can't even describe it, just like watching young like really wholesome families with children, and I've noticed a lot of that like when I get on the overground and stuff. So, people with babies that's something that's really lacking where my mother lives, it's all old people, so, there's no, no kids and just having like young kids around, it's like, I feed off that energy so much, so yeah, I love the, the beach for that reason, just like watching everyone go about their day it's just so like, just so lovely.

That's good, thank you. What is it about, and tell me more about young, like young people, young children.

I mean for me like it's not so much children, there's like an age where like boys grow up and all they care about is like guns and stuff, but it's before that, when they're like really young babies and toddlers, just makes me feel so happy, just that people are raising new life, like I mean, as scary as it is like raising a child and what the world is like becoming now, and how awful that's going to be for them, like I'm fully aware of that, but at the same time just like, I don't know, just like something about people, just starting a life, with like something that they have birthed themselves, is just insane to me, just like because I'm a very maternal person, like ever since I can remember all I wanted is a baby, so yeah, I think that really, really, I mean it's probably more because I'm a maternal person, more than anything, just like it, just yeah, just makes me feel like *pause* the Earth is like generating this like new energy and this is what it's going to become, but then I obviously, like I just said, I think about the really sad parts about how the world is deteriorating, so it's really awful for the kids, but I don't know, it's kind of nice for them to be around, even though their life is probably going to be terrible, but yeah, I don't know, just like it's, it's the purest kind of energy as well, like totally untainted by *pause*, by the whole kind of sinister life we all live now, like it's just like pure, I don't know, and it's just so calming, like babies are just so calming when they're not crying and all that stuff, they're just like, it's just tranquil, which yeah radiates onto everyone else I think, just like 'aah, calming little baby to sleep', like everything's good, no one has to worry about anything, but yeah, it just makes um, the area just like feels so much more lively compared to old people, just all sitting around like at the old people's club, like, like that's like dying life, I know that sounds like really, really horrible, but that is like, I mean, that's, that's the end of your life, like I'm glad they're having a great time at that old people's home, like live it up but, but it's more like new couples, young couples, because also I've noticed that, as well, is the couples in London that I've noticed like East London, on the overground and stuff, seem a lot younger than um the couple's I see back home that have kids, they all seem a lot older, so I don't really know what that's about, like why people here seem seem to be younger, but that just makes it, just makes me feel amazing because I wouldn't want to be a parent when I'm too old, like I'd like to be a parent on my like early thirties ideally, probably, um, yeah, I, and maybe this is actually stemming from what I was saying about my, my mom as well, because like I say my mom is like a different mother than what my brother and sister had, so maybe I think it's probably stemming from that, actually, because my mom is in her 50s now, so she's a lot older than she was like when well, how old is my brother? 28, so, I mean, yeah, say my mom's probably like, in her like 40s, when, 30s or 40s like when she was like fully raising my brother, actually, I think she was, she had my brother when she was like 26 or something, I can't remember but um, but yeah, I feel like I have watched my mum age like massively and because I say her life has changed so drastically in the last five years, it probably seems like she's a lot older to me than she actually is, but um, yeah, I would just, I just feel like it's almost unfair on a child to raise them when you're older, like my mom has, because I was an accident, I wasn't planned, so that's like a big, that's why I'm so, a lot younger than my brother and sister is, because they were planned and I wasn't, like a long time after. But, yeah, I just feel like it's almost unfair on a child to raise them when you're at an age where you're not like, or not even, not even it's an age thing, it's probably not even an age thing, it's like a mental age thing, because my boyfriend's mom is, you know, the same age as my mom, but she is like a vibrant young woman, kind of thing, and I just think you need to raise kids when you're still in touch with everything else that's happening, in like, in your local surroundings, in the bigger picture, like all, all these other things, I think you really have to be connected to, to just the world around you, if you're bringing, bringing up a child, like as opposed to just kind of be like in your own element, because you will really like... denying your child access of all these other like vibrant things that they could be a part of, which I guess is how I feel, but so yeah, I would like to be younger when I have a child, so I'm not, so I'm, I'm still active and I still want to do all these things with them, so I guess that's why I really like seeing like all the young couples, like actually being active with their kids, like just chilling, like where like everyone else is chilling, you know what I mean? Just like there are so many different people on that beach, that there's such a variety, there's like, there's parents with a lot of young kids, chilling with their friends, like who've taken their baby out, which I can imagine is quite a struggle like taking all the nappies and all that stuff that you need to take out when you have a child that young, so you have all, all of that, just to go sit on this beach and then you have like an older guy who's just been on his bike and decides to stop and just sit in the sun, there's me, who's just like by myself, reading a book, there's like a whole group of people like, I just like the diversity of that, of that beach and I like the fact that people call it a beach, because it's definitely not a beach, but people just call it that because like everyone around here knows it, that's just what they call it, but it just sounds very silly, but yeah, I think yeah, I just like the diversity of like all the people, they're just kind of like, might even just be walking home from work, they just sit and stopped just to enjoy the sun and that one bit, like everyone there is, is put there for the same reason, just like sitting in the sun, like a drawing, that's it, like that's it, it's just like pure enjoyment of what the sun is giving me... yeah.

Tell me about the diversity you mentioned.

Just like, I think the people, it's funny because like, basically, everyone in my house is lesbian and I am bisexual, so, but I didn't know many, many other lesbians other than the people in my household, because like I said, like when I was younger, I was denied that because everyone was very homophobic, so I couldn't even express myself and that, that sort of like, but um, but yeah, no, so we were on the beach and like it was me one of my flat, and two flatmates that are, two of my flatmates that are lesbians; one's in a relationship with another girl in the flat and then one's like single, anyway, and we just like look to the side and there's just like this whole group of, like a massive group of girls and my flatmate is just like 'oh, they're definitely lesbians', they come up to us and they're like flirting with us and then like, and all this stuff, and then we would just start talking and then you know, we go to their house a few weeks later for a party, so I mean, just like, like, there's like even like niche groups, because I fe-, yeah, I mean like I say, I don't really know that many other lesbians, so it's just kind of like, for me it's really nice to kind of open that box a little bit in such, like a, is more indirect because I guess in the past I've been like on Tinder and things like that, but it's really nice to just like do it really organically, just like meet someone on the green like, and that's it, you know, it's so much more organic than doing all the online... stuff, you just sit next to some people and they're nice and you'll chill and it's so cool, like everyone just has such a great and like there's no bad blood... ever, just everyone's just having the best time *chuckles*, everyone's super chill like, yeah, um, so I guess there's like, I mean, I guess I was talking about diversity in a sexual kind of sense, but um, but yeah even that it's just like nice, because like I hadn't been introduced to many people of that sort of like lesbian community and now I know that there's a huge lesbian community in Hackney Wick and that's good to be a part of, um... and then just yeah, I mean just like, there's just random anyone, like I've met so many people living here, people who I would never even think about, like not never even think about, but like would never cross paths with, um, I guess until, like we wouldn't be kissing, you know, like I say I'm younger like I wouldn't meet like some 40 year old raver guy, who does whatever he does every weekend, like that just wouldn't be in my social group, if I like stayed with all my 20-year-old friends and chilled with them the whole time, but I guess there's like a lot of diversity in the people that I meet and like their interest, I mean, the common interest of people who live in Hackney Wick is partying, because this is known as like a party area,  but um yeah, that beach is like, it's like all the party people, but everyone is just chilling. Everyone's just having a good day in the sun and yeah, I just, I just met a lot of people just like on that beach and then like I meet my flatmates' friends, we all hang out there, just a lot of different people, I'd never come into contact with unless you know, you're sat there... yeah.

Thank you. You mentioned that it's not like the online environment. Can you tell me more about the online my environment?

Just like, I mean, I was talking about Tinder because like I said, I've never really known any lesbians and when I grew up, even when I was at college, when I was 18, like anyone who was a lesbian was not saying they're a lesbian, they're not doing that for another couple of years, until they found their right people, kind of like what, what I've done like, I'm, I still struggle to speak about like bisexuality with people, because I am still very much affected of what I went through at college, like of people just like totally ripping me and my friend like, actually my friend (min 16:12) apart thinking we're in some sort of relationship when, when we weren't, but like it was just like... ruined our lives completely at college, so I still really struggle talking about that, so, I guess, and because I just don't really know many lesbians and don't really want to talk about it that much, so I'd go online, like on Tinder and stuff to find yeah, someone to sleep with or whatever um, and yeah, it's just so painful, like I've been on Tinder with girls and guys and it's just so painful like, just I had to delete it after a while when I first got it, because all you're doing on that app is forming relationships with people that you've never met, and like expecting a reply from someone that you've never met, like it's just insane, and I hate the whole like small talk of 'hey, how are you?', like 'what do you do', and having to explain what you do every single time, when I struggle to explain what I do like, it's just so much nicer to meet someone organically, like, and also, you know, that's something I'm totally denied of, if I were to live at my mom's, like I can't meet people organically, I can't, it's just, it's just like, there's no way of me being, being, being able to access anyone, who I feel like I can relate to, in any sense,  and um, yeah, so I guess I turned to boyfriends all the time or dating apps, all these things and all it was, the whole time, was just a way of me to like distract my mind of how little I have with, with other people, like my interactions with other people, how little those interactions are, I was trying to fulfil myself with talking to people online, you know, which is never going to work, you've never met them and you don't have any actual care for them, they're just a picture, then a message, that's it, it's just like, you have a relationship with a picture and a message, that's it, there's n-, nothing about it and I came to the point, like I said, of like expecting a text back or waiting for them to, you know, say something like flirty, or something stupid like that, and it's just like 'wow, I've never met this person', like this is so sad, like how his life even came to the point where like, where you just can't even talk to people, but I guess, you know, it must help so many people actually, all the Tinder and stuff, for people who are still, you know, living at home and like, like I was at my mom's, like that's actually helped a lot of people to actually get those interactio-, interactions, but it's not healthy, it's not like a healthy way of interacting with people, it's just, um, yeah loneliness in an app really, but then actually, you know, I said my two flatmates that are in a relationship, they met on, on 'Her', I think, I think 'Her' is a lesbian dating app, so I guess some people do find like love on it, but I don't think a lot of people are looking for love, they're looking for just meaningless interactions, sexual interactions.

How does that make you feel?

Well, I hate, I hate, I hate... so I went on one date with someone from Tinder and it, I hated going on a date with someone because what happened, what happens is, on these apps, is nothing can happen organically, because you're on an app and the second you send a message, it means 'I'm interested in you romantically, I've seen your pictures, I'm interested in you romantically', so from the second you start that date, there's no friendship, friendship doesn't exist in that date, like possibly you could get it afterwards, but it's like, say if you met like a nice person, wherever you are, and then you're like, 'oh', you get their like details and like 'oh, should we go for a drink on this night' and they're like 'yeah, sure', you can start a friendship from that, but when you, when you start on a dating app, that's all you are, you're romantically and sexually involved like from the get-go, you know, so it's just like, there's no room to take it slow, there's no room to like fully get to know that person for who they are, as opposed to something, as opposed to like a sexual object, because that's what they are from the second you send that message, it's literally, all it is is attraction, you know, it's just, it's really sad, like I really just dislike that thought of 'you can't be friends because you've met on like a dating app', like it just doesn't... and obviously that's not like a law, but it is just, it, that's how I felt on that date, it was just like, we're this now, like we're on a date, this is a date, this isn't just like us meeting up, getting a drink, seeing how it goes, like this is a date and we're probably going to sleep together later, like that's what it is, it's just like, it's pretty not nice and that also just makes you feel so objectified, like you're literally just a person to sleep with, in one of those apps I feel, I just struggle to see it any other way, yeah, it's um, it's quite brutal and it's just, I don't know, I just don't get it, like the same, like when someone, like you match with someone, it's like endorphin rush, kind of things, you know, you just feel good over nothing, like it means nothing, you haven't even met that person, it's not like when you meet someone and you're like 'oh, wow, I feel an attraction to this person, I feel, I feel this way and I feel that way and they're really nice or whatever', it's literally just like 'uh, we matched cool, let's see if we can hook up', like it's just like, it's really disgusting to me *pause*. But yeah, I mean, maybe that I'm, like for me sexually it's like if I am to sleep with someone I fully want to be involved with them and then I want, I want to love that person, but then, you know, I have flatmates who can sleep with someone and it can be nothing so, this is a very personal thing, this is like a, this is how I feel, I know like some people like get such great time out of it, but for me, I just like, I just really struggle with like sleeping with someone and not having a real emotional connection with them, like it seems, whenever I've done that, it feels like someone's taken something from me, like fully just like ripped something out of me *pause*, yes, is this okay?

Yeah, of course, no, I’m just in silence, in case you wanted to say more.

Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but yeah, I think I'm kind of done on that topic… of tinder.

Thank you. I was just going to ask you about, oh thank you, um, I was just going to ask you about, because you mentioned previously that, um, when you see your friends back in the countryside, like posting pictures on social media, like Instagram, being out in the pub and having fun and they didn't invite you and stuff, um can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, um, well, at that time I was feeling very vulnerable, because I was going through a breakup and all those silly things, um but also I was going through a lot of other things, like I lost like a drastic amount of weight, because I was taking this medication that like really messes with your appetite, so I was, I was really thin, I was really in a bad, bad way, and I, when they weren't inviting me to these things, in hindsight is, I know it's because and they even told me it's because they knew I couldn't get there, but I took it so personally, because I was like 'wow, these people are really supposed to be like my really good friends, they're supposed to be there for me, but they can't even ask me out for a drink when I'm like in a really bad place', so seeing it online of like, of that, just made me feel really unwanted, like really unwanted, maybe question if I was like too much for them, like all the things I was going through, like how much you can actually rely on someone else to take care of you emotionally, like that's pretty much all on you, um no one, no one actually like really truly cares about, about how you're doing, I mean, there are the odd people who do, but like from what I've experienced so far, like I haven't really come across anyone who like is totally committed to, to caring for someone else, but you know what? Neither am I, like I'm not committed to taking care for anyone else and you probably can't because you've got to take care of yourself first, but yeah, no, it was like this, the on Instagram thing, but the thing is, is, I've, I've like really had to put it in my mind recently that what you see on Instagram is so distant from, from reality, like I've always known that, but like it's really like really hit me recently, like I said to you about my boyfriend's mom, how her being this power woman, she is such a power woman, but she, she's very active on Instagram constantly. constantly, constantly, story after story after story, post after post after post, and I think through her I've kind of come to realize actually what we see on Instagram just isn't the reality, because like all her captions are just like super positive and she's a very positive woman, but it's like really intense, but I'm just like you actually don't, like you live this lifestyle, she's, you know, a yoga and Tantra teacher, so she's very like connected, she lives that lifestyle, but it's also just kind of like, I feel, I can't even put it into words. I feel like it's, it's almost a *sighs* it's um, ugh what's the word? I use it all the time, you're overcompensating for what you feel like you're lacking in certain areas and you need to come across to other people online about like who you are,  you know, I've noticed a lot of overcompensation, as well, like through Instagram, through real life, like again in the art world, where you have all these kids who like dress in such, such a way every single day and I used to dress in such a way every single day, you know, like big high-heeled boots on every day, like handbag, whatever, you know, fur coats, I was that like arty kid in college, but it's all, it really is, like looking back, like it's overcompensation, like when you feel like you can dress like how you want to dress or come across like how you want to cross on, how you want to come across on social media, like I feel like that's when you like really establish a true... like you kind of know who you are a bit more, rather than like trying to tell people who you are through all your posts, through your clothing, through all this other stuff that you're trying to like overcompensate for, because you're lacking in it, in like your Creative Studies or in your social life or whatever, like if you're constantly, I don't know, it just seems, it seems kind of like, I don't know, just like every time you're with someone, if you feel the need to post a picture with them like, so you're just trying to show everyone that you're with someone, like, like have fun in that room with that person, don't try and make it look like you're with all these people constantly, because you're going to make other people feel like they need to be living that lifestyle and really they don't, like each to their own.

How does that make you feel?

I mean, it's fine, like I think in the past it's made me feel quite lonely, but now, like I said like I come to terms with it and I just realized that like everyone, like everyone, social media is there for everyone, everyone has the right to use it in the way that they choose, choose to, but um for me, I used to post all the time on Instagram, all the time, all the time, like three times a day or something and it was stuff that I was interested in and I felt was genuine to me but, you know what? I deleted it all, now I post every like month. maybe, or something like that, maybe a bit more and I post not for any reason, like at all, sometimes I post my artwork, but I haven't done in a long time, but now I just post just because I feel like it, like there's no like real reason behind it. I'm not posting to try and show that I'm with this person or show that I'm doing this or whatever, I'm just posting because I just, I just think the picture is funny or something, like there's like no reason for what I post now, like I'm not trying to get anything across I don't feel, um, but I think yeah, I mean, I think that's great when people can do that, because people, I mean now, especially for my age group, you meet someone's Instagram page before you meet them, so you already have an idea of who they are, before you've ever even met them, so it's only natural for people to want to present themselves on social media in, in like the best light but *sighs* but I just, I'd rather be a bit more low-key about it, I'd rather someone like prefer my personality, rather than my Instagram's personality, yeah. I mean, I guess that's always been the way, it's not just Instagram, like when Facebook was a big thing, it was the same with Facebook, it's kind of like the amount of likes and stuff you get is how popular you are and all that bullshit, that actually really means nothing, but I guess when you're a kid, it feels like it means everything in the whole game of popularity, when you are a child, but yeah, it's just like, yeah posting pictures, especially when, when I was younger like, on Facebook, actually like posting, girls posting pictures of like what party they were out, who they're with or blah blah blah, it's all to just like prove that you're so popular and you're so this and you're so that, but like really, when you can just, when you don't feel the need to do any of that, that's like the best kind of confidence and beauty, just like not caring about how people like view your profile, it's so stupid.

Thank you, um okay, is there anything else you want to say about that? Can we talk about that, the box...

I feel like we've talked about this quite a lot, my mother's house, um maybe I should, should I think of something else, maybe?

No, no, you know what? If you, if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine like *gets interrupted*

I just feel like the one we did before, it was kind of like, I spoke so much about my mother's house, you know, already, I feel like I've kind of said everything I feel like saying about that.

Yeah, sure, okay, so that's it for this one, um, so, um, do you want to move on to the next section, the final one, which is, which is a questionnaire?
