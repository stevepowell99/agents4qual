Okay, thank you. So, can we start by talking about what you’ve put first, please?

For the first um picture I drew an individual on their own and next to a group of people, I'm tryna symbolize isolation because with, um, a lot of experiences of loneliness you feel, um, like you're by yourself and sometimes it can be thought as that: there's a group of people in the…in certain situations where um, you’re not involved, it can seem bigger than it is, so, say it might be two friends that go out and you're on your own and some people see that as a bunch of friends and everybody is kind of against you in that…this kind of situation, which can be quite isolating.

Hmm, so you’re saying that feeling of, or thinking that people are against you can lead to feeling loneliness. Tell me more about that.

So, there are situations where for everybody, um, you might not get invited to a party or um, go- going out and even though it might be one occasion there's, there’s certain times where you um think to yourself that…is, is it you? Or is it um, is it just that people don't want to be around you so then you start feeling um alone, in the sense that you're not around the people you would like to be and that kind of is what I drew for my second box where the paranoia comes in.

Um, tell me more about how that makes you feel knowing that let’s say you weren't invited to a party. Hmm, how does that make you feel?

Um, so maybe though once you might think, uh, maybe it wasn't good or, but with a lot of today's society not being included in something, which you're going to generally see on social media, you start um, thinking like why wasn’t I invited and then for me I might feel a bit, I wouldn’t like to say jealousy, but yeah, in that there's a sense of jealousy and of mix of emotions.

Hmm, tell me more about the emotions.

Um… so, again, one of them is jealousy um, another one is um, more… how can I put it? You’re, you kind of feel upset within yourself because, uh, you're not able to experience what other people are, so you feel upset within yourself and upset with your friends to why you're not maybe invited or involved in that kind of situation.

Mmh, and you mentioned that you might see a picture or something on social media.

Yeah.

Can you tell me more about that?

Um, well today literally, especially on that around these times, when summer comes, there's always gonna be a party every day, always gonna be an outing, um, so when you… when you see pictures that you're not involved in and it just generally seems fun, that's when you start feeling alone because you're not… with them, you’re not going to be in the background smiling or anything, it’s more you sitting down on your bed or something and you're looking, tapping, seeing that loads of photos… you can’t, can’t really escape these kinda um photos and these situations, where you're gonna bound to be and where you're not involved in.

Okay, is there anything else you want to say?

Um, it was just more the idea that even if um, again, it might be two people just going out, for a person like me, I might feel that there's a, it might seem worse than it is, so, um, it might seem like a group of people might be going up when it generally isn't like that.

So, you’re saying that there might be, you might be thinking of a bunch of people are going out, but then in reality, they’re not.

Mmh or situations on how it is, so even if they look like they're having fun like to whole, it might not be as fun as you think and that again is to do with the um, like pictures in social media and that.

Okay, tell me more about that, so you're saying that pictures are not necessarily accurate representations of, of the reality?

Yeah, um, a lot of things like, not me personally, but I see a lot of um, kind of people my age, they have to go out, maybe go to like Westfield or a shopping centre and they might be smiling and having fun, but then for the majority of the time they're just on their phones as well. So um, sometimes when I'm at, when I'm in a situation where I'm not involved in something, I do kind of have to take into account that we're just seeing the highlights and I think that's what fools you, just can make, make you feel even more lonely because you're seeing like the best situation, or something that, that necessarily wasn't that great.

So, seeing something on social media can make make you feel lonely?

Yeah, definitely, definitely.

Seeing like others doing something can make you feel lonely?

Definitely.

Um, okay, is there anything else you want to say?

Hmm, no, nothing.

So, um, can we talk about what you’ve put for box, box 2?

It was more kind of *gets interrupted*

Is it ok, if you could speak a bit louder because I need to record the…

Yeah.

Thank you.

So, for the second box it was more to do with um, what lonely can make you feel, um in a sense of um being paranoid, so for viewing stuff on social media or just in general friends, you start thinking within yourself ‘have you done something wrong?’ Or ‘did I say something wrong?’ So that's what I was trying to express in this kind of… drawing because loneliness can lead to a, a world of emotions and paranoia is a big one of them.

Okay, tell me more about paranoia, so what kind of, yeah tell me more about that?

Um with a look at today's society, um you have, your quiet self… um… obsessed. It could be positive or negatively influenced, but a lot of stuff through, the example of going out or just the way you look, th-, a lot of paranoia is built up. So, you, you tend to look at yourself in the mirror more, um check your views or just see if your shoes are clean and there's a lot of thoughts building up because you wanna present yourself a certain way or not be excluded from certain situations where you might be lonely.

Hhm, so you're saying that, basically, right now, there's a lot of, you know, observance around self-image, caring about what other people think about us and so on, tell me more about that.

Um, so again, it's back, back to this kind of fear, like I think loneliness is a fear in today's society, um so um like in certain situations where we as like people, we see ourselves as lonely, we might not be lonely, but the whole kind of fear built of be, fear built up around being lonely brings in this kind of emotional paranoia, so um, we don't want to be lonely, so we kind of think, overthink situations which um, help us in our eyes not be lonely. Does that make sense?

Umm, so you’re saying that um, you know, this today's society puts sort of pressure on people to, to, to, to have to be a certain way and in order to fit in essentially. How does that make you feel?

Well, it's kind of stressful like as an, as a feeling it’s stressful, again, there's positives to it but negatives as well, so a lot of the negatives is the pressure, being overwhelmed with your image, um… like with me, I like to go to the gym, I start-, I’ve being going to the gym for a couple of years, even if it's just to, to, at first it might have just been to honestly show people that I'm going to doing something but then you start taking into account ‘Oh someone, my friend is starting to have bigger muscles, why am I, why am I not getting bigger muscles?’ Like ‘what am I gonna do about it?’. So, you go to the gym, again that’s that kind of feeling of like paranoia, ‘am I not good enough for the person you're with.’ There's, there’s other things that, like for me I might feel um stressed under the sense that um… ‘Am I not wearing the latest shoes?’ Shoes are a big thing in today's society, ‘Are my shoes not clean’ and there's just loads of pressures and expectations in today's society that um if not, if not in line with, you can be what we feel to, seem as lonely, um so it’s the kind, like I said, it's the kind of fear that if you're not looking a certain way, you're not having your muscles a certain way, you'll be excluded, you’ll be isolated and then end up lonely and I think that's what, um, the kind of feeling of fear and loneliness it stems from.

So you're saying that there's a lot of social comparison in today's world, um, and you're constantly comparing yourself socially to others and um in order to live up a certain way and so on and you’re saying these are stressful, um okay and, and, and that social comparison, tell me more about that, how does that make you feel?

Um… the social comparison side again is um, sometimes you feel positive, so free apps like Snapchat, um where you have private stories and um you kind of show you're doing something, so yesterday I went out, I would snap that just because I want people to see, that kind of comparison because for me it's comparing my lifestyle for others to see and view and compare themselves to. So that kind of, that kind of snap of me, maybe with my friends, makes me feel better inside in comparison to someone that doesn't and it's mo-, it's more about recognition from o-, again is recognition from other people now thinking about it, because generally I was with friends, genuinely I was with friends, I could just enjoy their own company, but I felt the need to um for others to see and compare themselves with to make myself feel better. So, I think um a lot of today is based on comparisons, um negatively, um me just seeing like again because I know about the like exercise and gym, seeing someone go to the gym and like maybe wearing a tank top you can compare yourself to them and think like ‘Oh, I've been going to the gym the same amount of them, the same time as them and yet I can't see the same kinda um gains or results’, so then you feel bad within yourself and then again you start thinking like ‘what have I done?’.

So social, social comparison can make you feel inadequate in some ways, if it doesn't.

Yeah.

Okay and how does that make you feel, when you, when you sort of feel like other people have better sort of things than you?

It just, you kind of feel disappointed, um sad like and it's all to do with yourself like, because I think what I tend to do is that I tend to look for, what’s the word?, I'll tend to look for answers within myself, so why I don't maybe look a certain way, then you just feel more sad and more depressed and you start, you have one of them days where you really reflect on yourself and you think like ‘what can I do to feel better?’, like I think, um again there is positives to social comparison, but some days you ,like with me, I can really feel down with myself, just for the pure fact that I might not have something that someone else has, won't be able to do something and experience something that someone else has, has done.

Okay, is there anything else you want to say?

Um… I think that with kind of par-, being paranoid, um again, there's a, there's a limit to it, I think with today's society because everybody has self-questions and um questions, I'm so sorry, and thinks about how to improve themselves and I think with certain apps you can, you can challenge yourself in a positive way. So, um sometimes when you see a picture of a kind of muscular man or muscular women, you kind of feel the need that ‘Ah I should go to the gym’ or like do activities that just make me better. So, I think there is positives but then what happens is with me, I tend to get overwhelmed with the, the amount of pictures I see, especially with summer like, as soon as Christmas finishes, it's about the summer body and then at first you feel um kind of positive, but then the constant being bombarded with pictures and photos of muscles, and, and, and swimwear, everything, it just, it kind of ruins your kind of path into yourself, so you kind of lose, at first you have a target for yourself, but then you lose the target of what you wanted to reach your goal, and you can just become blinded by other people's ambition. That's what I think, well, that's what happens, that's what happened to me when I first started kind of, this kind of social media thing.

Okay, thank you. Is there anything else?

No.

Can we start by talking about what you’ve put in box three, please?

Whoa, I've expressed kind of what I think lonely-, a part of loneliness is and I think that a big part of that is music, um music is a way where people have a feel happy, sad, um hopeful, disappointed if they're in grief and I think one big part of music is being lonely. So, a lot of people, including me, use it as an escape to why I may feel lonely, a lot of artists express thems-, a lot of artists express themselves and how they feel lonely and for people that like, might come across that kind of experience of being by themselves, being, being isolated, I think music can help um solve that kind of emotion because you can relate to the, to the music being played or it kind of just feels another… a gap that you're missing, so you might feel like you're, you’re lonely and I think that um music, it can bring something to a person's emotional state that nothing else can.

You mentioned something about escaping, you, tell me more about.

Um, yeah so music is an escape and anytime you feel, every time I feel down or anytime I feel happy, I just turn to music because um it's an experience, soon as you turn up the volume or you're walking you kind of look at the world in a different light, it could be um you could feel more happy and look at the world and think ‘why is it a bit brighter?’, so it could  or you could be sad and just reflect on the world and reflect on your past and I feel like music for me it does that, so and the thing with music is that you can experience it on your own and I think that's a key kind of concept to it because when I feel lonely I can, I can listen to music by myself and I can feel a sense of, I want to say completion, but a kind of sense of um comfort, I feel like music helps you escape your, your original state, kind of develops it or changes it completely.

Okay, so you're saying that, basically, music helps you to kind of be more at ease, it helps you to escape from whatever you're at.  So, tell me more about its connection to loneliness.

Okay, so, with music and being lonely, I feel like again a lot of artists ex-, express that kind of loneliness, there's so much genres in music and I think a lot of artists today express being lonely or feeling sad, so I think that for me if I feel lonely or am I at a down point I will list-, turn to the artist I can relate to, so we can kind of share this, well for me, I can share this loneliness with them and then understand my emotion better because again, a lot of things is when you feel lonely, but you don't realize or you might feel jealous and you're thinking ‘why do I feel jealous?’, and I think that listening to music can help you real-, realize why you feel this way through the words that an artist may speak or just even a tone of the song like a lot of, a lot of your feelings can be feelings of loneliness, can be determined by the music you listen to or can help you understand why you feel lonely better and another side to music is that it can help you escape feeling lonely. There's, there's loads of up-beat songs, again there’s loads of genres that just can change your mood completely um and I feel like when you feel lonely or you feel isolated or paranoid, again stems from loneliness, I feel like um… music can, can change that.

Thank you, tell me more about what it makes you feel when you listen to music.

Um… again, because music has such a wide variety if I listen to, if I listen to hip-hop, I feel this kind of um authentic like, like, a bit of an upbeat to my, tempo to myself and just the way I walk or it just changes your attitude to life completely like you feel, you feel a sense of history like just listening to the music. Um, sometimes I listen to UK kind of rap ‘The Lyricist’ and I could listen to a song five times in a row and still not fully understand what they said and then when you realize the words that they're speaking and you can relate to it, it's just the best feeling in the world. Like music is this a good wonderful thing.

And um… and um… and so you're saying that when you have experienced a sense of loneliness you turn to music because it kind of changes your mood and things, tell me more about um, tell me more about um, so tell me more about what happens after you stop listening to music.

When you stop listening to music, that's the good thing about music, you, your me doesn't change back to the same way it was, it's kind of a, it's a temporary and permanent fix so I could listen to, like with me, I wake up in the morning and I'll turn music on to make myself feel better, um even, even if it's just to wake me up, I feel, I still feel woken up after um I stop listening to music. Um I think that kind of works with how you feel before, with emotions of like loneliness, um I feel like depending on the music you're listening to and for what cause, it doesn't just, your emotion doesn't turn back to how it was after stopping to listen, listening to music, I feel like it continues throughout the day and I think it's a, it's a powerful thing, so, um, just listening to music and stopping, it does help you progress into like your day or what you're feeling in a positive light.

Thank you, and, and, and tell me more about the experiences, yeah, the experiences that lead you to listen to music.

Mmh, um… so there's loads of experiences in my lifestyle which I listen to many, many different types of music, so um I come from a Caribbean background, Trinidad is known for soca and Carnival. That, that type of genre of music, it brings people together so much like it's, it’s amazing. I remember going in 2012 and it's just, you just you Carnival for how it is, which is just people enjoying themselves and coming together and again, I couldn't say that, that kind of solves the, the idea of being lonely because if you listen to soca, it brings people together, brings, it’s kinda, it has a culture and history too behind it, which people, so many people can relate to, so I feel like experiences of soca and listening to that type of music can make you be a certain way, which is just being family-orientated, even if it's not blood rel-, close, being, being around people that love what you love which is soca can just influence how you are completely.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about music and… okay, um… can we talk about you’ve put in box four, please?

Um… I said that um, I’ve kinda tried to express what loneliness can bring which is a state of different emotions, um it could be heightened and, like to being happy to being um sad. It's just that kind of imbalance of uncertainty um how you feel.

Mmh, tell me more about this imbalance of uncertainty.

So, I don't think loneliness is just a feeling, I think it, again is, it creates different feelings that you feel with the time, so most of, most of people think loneliness is being sad or upset, but again, you can feel angry, you can feel confused, you can feel, I can feel um… happy is, is, is, even though it's a flip to being sad sometimes being lonely can make you feel happy at the same time because it gives you a chance to reflect on yourself and reflect on others. So without feeling lonely, I can't appreciate being um not lonely, if that makes sense, there's this, I feel like everybody has these days where they're by themselves and then you can learn to appreciate it. So, I feel like loneliness helps you, not helps you but makes you feel different, different ways.

So, you're saying that sometimes when you're lonely it gives you the chance to reflect, it gives you a chance to see how you're going… tell me more about that.

Yes, so, it's a process, um, I think with me, from my experiences, when I feel lonely of, I feel um… sad, like automatically, then once you're in that state, you can do, I feel like I develop into being kind of confused, or, or just in a state where you don't really know what to ex-, um feel, more b-, again that can lead back to being paranoid because you don't know how to react to um this kind of feeling of loneliness, you don't know why, you don't know who done it you just reflect and reflect, then I think that reflection then causes you to feel happy and then appreciative ‘cause you can understand your emotions better and other people’s kind of actions to why you feel this way.

Mmh, you’re saying that it gives you a chance to understand why people do things the way they do and why you behave, can you tell me more about that?

Um, so, this kind of sense of reflection um, again um lonely, because there's so much parts to feeling lonely, at first you might view a picture on Snapchat and be jealous something, ‘why am I not there?’, after you've reflected on that you can, you can understand a picture in a different way, as much as how music changes your perspective, the whole process of being lonely can change your perspective on others. So, when I view this, the picture for the second time, I can, I can understand maybe they don't, they don't, they didn’t need me there or they just didn't think to ask. I think that kind of constantly reflecting whilst being lonely can cause you to positively understand people's intentions because with me, I feel, when I, when I feel lonely, I feel like it's the other person not wanting to, to interact with me, but then after and reflecting and then becoming a bit more positive, you can find alternative views into why the person acts away towards you.

And, and how would that, how does that make you feel?

Um… a sense of relief, so it was talking about pressure. I feel like loneliness brings pressure to, to the kind of mind and to oth-, like to people around you as well, but um, I feel like once you understand, grasp that concert, concept *correct* and understand why it is you feel a way you do or why you feel lonely, I feel like it releases this kind of pressure and you feel relieved and um, I feel that you're more able to understand and you can learn from the past because there’s, once you understand why you feel lonely and the situation you was in to make you feel lonely, if that happens, ever happens again, the relief to know that you can see an alternative, I think that's the best part.

Um, is there anything else you want to say about that?

Nah.

Okay. Is there anything else you want to say about anything else?

Um, it was, it was more to do that, I think a big part of being lonely is um within oneself as well. I don't think um… a lot of people understand that being lonely can be solved with just issues within yourself and I, I feel like we find ways to blame other people for feeling lonely and I feel like social med-, a big part of that is social media letting us feel that way because you're not there and you think there's, a picture can tell so many stories and I feel like, if you feel lonely and you see a picture, you will you choose the most negative story, but I feel like as I'm getting older I can understand that there's just, there's just different ways you can overcome this like experience of being lonely. I feel like people don't understand themselves and I think that they should learn to find, the process of being lonely, learn to find a better outcome.

Tell me more about the better outcome.

A better outcome is just, is not feeling all these emotions of jealousy, pressure, envy and um self-hatred, I think that, that's the kind of, the kind of concepts for me, um I feel like people need to learn that there's a better outcome to feeling lonely, which is just to appreciate, to appreciate yourself more, um I feel like when you're alone, you don't appreciate yourself and you don't appreciate others, you just see kind of… isolate, being isolated and not being around the stuff you wanted to be and wanted to be, I feel like the better outcome is you learning to, to accept that being lonely is okay and to accept that half of the time you feel lonely or you've experienced loneliness, you're not actually lonely, um I don't think anybody in this world is lonely, but um I feel like we tend to, to, when we experience loneliness we tend to result in to call ourselves lonely, I feel like the better outcome is just understanding that there's always going to be someone, maybe a blood relative, friends, or a random person, once you realize that there's a, there’s a better side to, of feeling this loneliness, you can understand that you're not lonely.

You said that no one is lonely, they think they're lonely, can tell me more about that, please?

Well, the way I look at life is that there’s 7 billion people in the world and I feel like, you can, there's always going to be someone that you might not even know yet, but there's always going to be someone that's there for you. So, the, the best way I could think of it is just talking about maybe a homeless person, yeah, they might not have nothing, no family, no house and that's the best way you can, that's the best way, but that's, that's probably the most way I could I could feel that loneliness could affect someone, but I feel like charities like, that’s how I’m thinking about it, charities, they support this kind of, charities that support homelessness can help provide the sort, a place of shelter, warmth and food and um I feel like that doesn't make you lonely, again you might not know, the homeless person might not know that there's a charity, so they've experienced loneliness, but I feel like nobody could ever be fully lonely because there's always going to be someone that’s just there, there for you. Um, there’s just, even though there’s bad, bad things in the world, I think there’s, there’s so much good.

So, you’re saying that some, when someone's there for you, you're less likely to feel lonely?

Yeah.

Okay. Hmm, is there anything else you'd like to say?

Um and when you said someone there for you, again like they, they don't, you might not know them, but they're just so, if there's someone that cares about or can relate to your cause, then there's no way you could be lonely.  Yeah, that's…

So you're saying that if you have similarities with someone, then, or if you have sort of, you share some sort of impact, you don't feel lonely.

Yeah, and I feel like that's why music helps as well, because you can share that, that kind of feeling with someone else, um I feel like once you can relate to someone then the loneliness goes, the sense of loneliness goes.

So, relating to someone, um so tell me more about this.

Um, so, what's an experience that I've had? Uugh, okay, so being, being an only child, um you can feel lonely, um but… um I'm not gonna say I'm lonely, I experienced loneliness, but I feel like if I can relate that same kind of loneliness with another, then it just makes it all the better; um or not even necessarily being an only child, but just kind of childhood bring-ups that resulted to where I am today. I think growing up, that's made you so much, so much less lonely than you could do, if that makes sense. So, growing up you'd, you'd think that um, stuff like, maybe just like going to family outing with your mom, but you're just, it's just you because you and your mom, you can relate that to someone else growing up, now you would think back about it, your friends share that same kind of bring ups that, that, they might only have a mum and you can relate to that, so your experience in loneliness and then understanding that other people experienced um similar things can make you less lonely, like, again, not lonely, but can make you feel less lonely.

Thank you, cheers. Okay. Is there anything else? Okay, cool, I’m gonna cancel the recording.

Okay, thank you. Can we talk about, can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the, the first one? Thank you.

So, for the first box…

I think it's okay, I can hear it from that, it's a good, strong recording.

For the first box, the place I most feel socially connected in my neighbourhood is probably the, just the market, um that might sound like a weird place, but there's so much exciting things happening in the market, so much cultures, so much cuisines, so much… um clothing and it's just, just crazy, like thinking about it, um, I feel like the, the local market just could make you feel so connected in a way you can never feel. Um, I feel like being in London, in general, that's another way you cannot feel lonely because there's so much cultures and so much experiences within people that can just, just, just makes you feel connected like on, like on another kind of grand scale. Um… even if you walk through the market on your own, just experiencing a person's trades, they were just screaming ‘fresh fruit’ or just speaking another language, you might even not know what they're saying, but you feel a sense of connection because you're in a place where everybody feels belong, a sense of belonging, if that makes sense, there's no kind of um, there’s all diversity and no kind of exclusion.

So, you’re saying that, you know, that diversity of cultures, you know, makes you more connected. Can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, so, being, being in a diverse, diverse neighbourhood, I feel like um, the, it makes you feel connected because there's so much different pathways and there’s so much different people, which are comfortable. I think comfort is such a huge way of feeling connected, if someone feels com-, comfortable in the surrounding, then it just makes it so much easier to feel socially connected because then you're more able to speak to someone on the street or say good morning, you’re more able to maybe ask for directions. I think um being comfortable in a place where’s all diverse and all different, can make you feel connected as well.

So being comfortable with people, you know, seeing people from different cultures and backgrounds can, can make you feel more connected. Tell me more about the comfortableness.

I think the comfort stems from… your surrounding environment and within, um I think, if, if you're comfortable within yourself, then you're comfortable with others. That's a huge thing today, a lot of people are not comfortable within themselves, so then, they, they don't like this kind of way of life for others. So, I think be, growing up in a place where you're exposed to so much different, so much different things, culturally, racially, you're able to be more acceptant and then you could be, then therefore you can be acceptant within yourself as well, or, yeah, I think, I think being, being exposed to this kind of diversity, can make you just feel like a sense of belonging as well, um and kind of, again that kind of sense of relation, so yeah.

Hmm, okay, is there anything you want to say?

Um… yeah, just be-, again like just being exposed to different things and new things, can make you feel connected because, again you, when you walk through a market, I think the market is a perfect example, now that I’m thinking about it, because you've got different languages, different foods and different clothing and you find these clothing at the other side of the world, your finding it on your doorstep and I think that, once, like with me, when I reflect on that, I feel connected just, I feel more connected than ever because it's the idea that you're being exposed to a different lifestyle, You’re, you, you're given the chance to be exposed to a different lifestyle, which can make you feel more, um… more intrigued to what they're doing like in London, if that makes sense, and then that's when the social side comes to, where you can, you can, you can feel connected with other people because you can, you can be able to talk to them or just learn from um what they're doing as a, as a job, just watching them.

Okay and how does that make you feel?

Proud, that's what I'm feeling… proud like you can, you can stand tall and say that you're, you’re surrounded by, you can feel connected and surrounded by a place where, where everybody can feel welcome. I think that’s, that's the best feeling to just feel proud.

So, feeling welcome is what makes you feel connected in a way.

Yeah.

Okay, is there anything else?

No.

Can we talk about what you’ve put in box two, please?

Um, even though the park is a crazy place as well to do with culture and stuff, you can fell that lonely as well: I think most of the times when I'm walking through a park by myself and listening to music, I don't think, again, I don't think it's feeling lonely, but you can, it gives you a chance to reflect on a, on a, on a different level, so, um sometimes I might walk through a park and there's so much things happening, the kind of same laughter, and, and variety I might find in a market, yet when you walk through a park and you just see trees and nature, it gives you more time to reflect on life on a, on a different scale, which can then lead you to feel lonely, but I, I think a park is different to a, maybe a market, because a market, you're just experiencing live-action just intensity, while when you're in a park, you might be peaceful, you're more exposed to the, like the greenery of the world and even though it might sound weird, you’re more exposed to life itself like true, like, like, life in its purest than what life has become, so I feel like that's when you can start reflecting on um how you feel and if you feel lonely, yeah, so I feel like park is where I feel most lonely.

Tell me more about when you said that, you know, it’s the most purest.

Yeah, so um the thing with a market, you, you can feel connected because you or I feel connected because I understand that we've all come from a certain background or a certain part, however, you’ve got here, we've all got here at this time, working and experiencing life as it is, with a park because there's like, maybe fields got um plants, trees, um so you, you can reflect on life and on a different way, um you can reflect on why, like you can reflect, reflect on its beauty, this nat-, um there’s naturalistic element more than social, so then you start reflecting on its beauty and then you start thinking and wondering, or I start thinking and wondering what has, like what was life and what has it become, so then that kind of reflection of a deeper meaning, sometimes you can turn to being, feeling, feeling lonely, just, just because you're in a state of mind where you're just really thinking about life.

Hmm, so you're saying that being in a sort of park, environment, nature gets you to think deep, more deeply and, and that can lead you to feeling lonely.

Yeah.

Tell me more about that deep thinking.

With this kind of deep thinking, again like, so um with me, I'm just, all I’m thinking about is walking through the park and listening to music and just taking in the atmosphere, um taking in the atmosphere, um understanding that there's, the, the, like the wind is blowing a softer way or the grass is green or is just, there’s, in different types of the season it might be brown or green, just understanding all of this kind of aspects of life, it makes me feel that um, again, you can feel appreciative but then you can think ‘why’ and I think that's a lot of why you feel lonely because you don't know, so I think this kind of, this, this question of why or what if, or, and just um relating it to, to nature, you start thinking about, thinking about it with yourself, I think that's a com-, again that's why you can feel the sense of comparison, um talking about comparative, I think just that small comparison of why or what if, you start just talking about, just thinking about it in a sense of nature and grass and why the grass is green, you start thinking like ‘Why am I, why am I here?’, ‘Why am I not with friends or something like that?’, I think that small comparison with young people today can make them feel lonely, well, make me feel lonely this way, but that’s how your thoughts wonder, so yeah.

Tell me more about those ‘what ifs’ and ‘why’s’.

Um… to do with myself or just in general?

What did you mean?

So when you say, when I walk through a park I might think ‘Why, why is, why is it, why is the grass greener today?’ or why is the, the trees’ bear or something like that, you just, you just wonder, but then you start thinking to yourself like ‘Why, why am I walking through the park by myself?’ like it's just them silly questions and then you might think ‘let’s look on social media’, while you're walking through the park, where my friends are and I'm not with them and then that kind of chain… reaction of asking questions leads you to feeling the state of loneliness, I feel like when we don't know the answer to something, we start feeling a world of emotions and that world of like, world of emotions kind of is what loneliness is um and I feel like, that again, to go back to what I was previously saying, after you understand why you feel that way, then you can begin to realize you're not lonely, but when you when you're walking through the park and just experiencing all of these questions on your own, then it leads to feeling um lon-, like the sense of loneliness.

So, you’re saying that when you’re walking in the park and then, and um, and you might pick up your phone and then see that, you know, some people are there and you're not there. Tell me more about the park itself that makes you more prone to feeling…

Because again the park is so, it could be so quiet at times and so packed, um… the way I can relate to is or think of a kind of setting is say you're walking enjoying or questioning life, and then you look on your phone and you see your friends enjoying life, then you look around and you see people enjoying life because it's a park and you start, you know like that kind of again that chain reaction, you start thinking ‘Why, why am I not enjoying life?’ or ‘Why am I not enjoying life as other people are?’ That's, that, that's the key, that's, I think that's what the main thing is… comparing yourself, so you've already compared yourself through the phone and then being in a park comparing yourself to others in real life, in real time, it can make you feel worse, it can influence yourself even more to feel a certain way of loneliness.

So, you’re saying that when you’re at a park you tend to have a tendency to reflect on things.

Yeah.

Be it on your phone that you compare yourself, be it on, for example, outside of social media… tell me more about that outside social media.

Um well, get outside social media to some is a scary place, not to me because I'm quite open, but, so I know social media is kind of a show, it just blinds so many people to make, to make them feel a certain way, well just to make them feel happy or despair about themselves. There's so much, so much things social media can influence and I feel like once you step outside of that it could feel, it could feel nerve-racking because you can't, you can't do stuff in the clicking, in the click of a button, you can’t get to know people or deal with people just by like deleting them or blocking them, like you have to face with real life struggles, which is understanding how they’re, they’re speaking to you or the tone in which so, even though it's just common human interaction, a lot of people don't know what to do and I think that once you understand that there's more to life than just blocking people, that there's a whole process in you getting to know someone or getting to um talk to some, like talk to someone like or, or just sharing emojis and there's more to, more to that than I think that, that, that sense of, that pressure it just goes. And I think that that’s what's happening with young people, but a lot of older people like just learn, learning, as you get older you learn that there’s more to life than social media.

Hmm, thank you. Is there anything else you want to say?

No.

Thank you.
