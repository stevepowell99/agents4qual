Okay. Thank you, so can we start by talking about what you've put first?

Yeah, so the first box I drew a person, um… me, by myself, this being physically alone and feeling I have no one to talk to, feeling like there's no way that I can go and feel wholesome and yeah, I'm just with no one around me physically, like isolated.

Thank you, so, tell me more about that, so you being alone and physically isolated from people.

Yeah, um… I feel like, when you're alone, like when you're by yourself, you feel lonely, like you feel like there’s, you kind of feel like there's actually nobody there, when you're actually physically alone and even, in one of my other boxes you see you can feel alone, even when you're surrounded by people, but when you're actually physically by yourself and it’s just you and your thoughts, that's when like you start to actually realize that, you kind of like think about who’s actually there for you, who you can call on, especially if you're going through something, you assess who's around you and who you can actually call on in times when you're at your lowest and you're by yourself, yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Um… I feel like I have got quite a good support network. So even when I am physically alone, I don't feel alone and I'm quite, I’m a spiritual relit, like I’m a believer of God, so, I never usually feel like alone and such, even when I physically am alone, but definitely when I am alone I, I enjoy alone time, to be honest, I do enjoy alone time, but there have been times where I felt quite lonely when it's just me and myself, when I'm going through something, yeah, yeah.

So, you're saying that you could be going through some loneliness when you're going through, going through something.

Yeah, um yeah so when I'm down and I'm by myself the feeling of loneliness confuse me a bit more than as to what it would do when I'm on a higher or I'm happy, so yeah, when I'm alone, I just feel, when I'm down, I feel the loneliness just a bit more, like when I'm down, I like to be around people like for the comfort and stuff, but that's probably, when I'm by myself that's just maximized when I'm going through something, ‘cause I feel like there's no one here to actually like comfort me or hear me, what I'm saying, or see what I'm going through because no one's actually physically here.

How does that make you feel?

Umm… *pause* So when it’s, when it's a low time, it’s low, so obviously I feel, I feel sad at times, um but like I said, it's hard to feel lonely when you, when you do believe in God because you know that like, like when you believe in a spirit, you know, it’s always there, but at the same time having people, feeling like you don't actually have people to turn to, to speak to that it's also quite like, is actually just like, especially because I'm someone that I can always, I'm always the comforter, like all my friends always come to me and stuff, so when I feel like I can't come to them, it's like, it's annoying, it is annoying, it is annoying. Obviously at the time it's sad, when I look, when I reflect on it, normally, I'm just being like a bit over the top, like my loneliness, the way I feel it and experience it, it’s just a bit more dramatic, when I'm down, yeah.

Tell me more about that.

Um… so, I’m trying to think of a time, like there’s been times where I’ve had like arguments with people, arguments with family members, all at the same time, or even like with exam stress, okay exam stress, that was really tough, ‘cause I finished my exams yesterday, so with the exam stress I was the only one in my house that was going through the exam stress, so when I'm feeling the pressure and I'm thinking ‘okay, I've got four exams this week’, no one else was feeling that pressure, so I felt quite low, so when I'm in my room studying, everyone's making noise, I'm feeling alone because you're not really, you're not getting what I'm doing, but, and I was low, I was stressed and I was crying even if you try and comfort me but you, you really you don't get it, you don’t get it and I thought like I was, I wasn't within my right to even turn to you and project my stress onto you because why, you haven’t got an exam to sit, there’s no reason for you to be stressing, but um… yeah, yeah but yeah my exam season I was quite low, but then, on the other hand, I have friends that were also going through it as well, so I could, but, in actual physically being alone, it was just me, when I’m revising by myself, just me and that exams me sitting the paper, it was quite um… alone, it's just me, so yeah.

So, basically, people not understanding you that makes you feel alone.

Yeah, definitely, definitely, like even with my career and like my vision and stuff, when people don't really understand what I want to do, it’s frust-, it can be frustrating when you, when they don't really understand what I, like what I'm trying to do, want I’m trying to build. Um… even when it comes to like, in arguments as well, when people don’t really understand where I'm coming from, yeah, that's annoying, can feel quite alone, that as well. Um… yeah, yeah. Sometimes when you have a unique way of thinking and other people don't get it, definitely feel quite alone, even though it's not a phy-, it's not a physical ‘I'm feeling lonely’, but it's a mental, it’s like ‘Ugh, you just don't get it’ so when I'm planning stuff and I'm doing things, it's like, after I think twice about who I'm telling as well, because it's like, you don’t really get it, I get it, but you don't really get it. I have, I have to be mindful because there have been times where I’ve like spoken to people about things that I want to do, what, I've been quite alone in my way of thinking because they're just ‘okay, I want to go to uni, I want to do this, I want to do that’, and obviously I do want to go to uni but there are other things that I've been wanting to do as well, but because you don't really see how, you don't really see the vision and that for me can just be a bit ‘okay, I'm by myself in this, I need to build this for myself, I need to just do, take my own journey’ and that's good, but again, it can get lonely.

And what did you write here on the box?

Um… I said ‘physically alone’, ‘isolated’, ‘disconnected’ and ‘nobody to talk to’.

So, having nobody to talk to makes you feel lonely?

Yeah, yeah, yeah it does, it does, especially because obviously like, I do have a good network, but there are certain personal things that like you can't go to… people, where, everyone's got their own things that they can't take to everyone and it's about knowing who you can talk to, who you can’t talk to, but there are times where it's like I just don't even want to project, I don't want to be a burden on someone else, so I don't really want to talk to you about my problems, so I just take it all myself and again that does kind of make me feel lonely, it does, what, over, as I've grown older, I started to just learn that like, it’s the way it is sometimes and like when you meet, you meet different people, you learn that you can interact and like share differences, share your thoughts and feelings differently with different people, so like my best friend, like I feel like I can tell her most things, but even with her, there's still some things that like, I can't, like I wouldn't want to tell her, just, just, it doesn't matter, I don't want to be a burden on, on her. So again, yeah, can be, can be lonely.

And how does that make you feel, not being able to share those or just putting everything on your own, on your own shoulder?

Um… obviously, when I'm low, I feel it more, than when I'm settled down, and I feel like stressed, overwhelmed, but in general, I don't see it as a bad thing because I know it's, whatever I go through by myself, it’s just shaping me and it's making me into the person that I am today, like I feel like I think I'm a good person, I'm a strong person, so I'm always grateful for what I go for, I go through, but at the same time, when it is actually happening to me, it’s hard to see that, it's only like when I come out of a situation, I can look back and say ‘actually you’ve went through that by yourself, well done’, but at the time it can be a bit like, yeah, like I could do some support or can do some of this or that, but afterwards I’m p-, I’m proud of myself when I get through things... yeah.

Thank you. Is there anything else you want to add?

Hmm, no I kind of spoke about…

No, I’m talking about box one.

Oh, box one, okey, box one that’s fine, I think that’s everything, yeah.

Okay, thank you. Can we start talking about box two, please?

Hmm, so I’ve done a picture, I drew a picture of someone that's speaking, but like with a cross over it, so basically like you're speaking, but no one's hearing what you're saying, um and I wrote ‘it’s feeling like you don't matter and your voice isn't heard’. Um… and I feel like that was more representative of the people that I work with, so when I mentor young people, people from like backgrounds like mine, with like, from low-income areas, young black Asian boys, people that aren't heard and obviously I'm a part of that demographic, and I'm talking across like maybe like politics and stuff like that, it's just actually feeling like things that are happening to us aren’t being projected they way it should and we're speaking, we’re crying out for help, but nobody is listening to us, so… yeah, to like, even today like we’ve, I was talking about, I was talking about like the spread of violence that we’re seeing and I almost see it like all this violence, all these things that are happening, is like cries for help, it’s all cries for help and it’s like, we're just kind of isolated. We’re a community that's just being pushed under, all talking about us like on the media, in the media and stuff like that, only politicians making decisions about us but like no one's actually interacting with us and no one is actually, no one is actually speaking to us and asking us what we need or just, they're just trying to make decisions on our behalf without even interacting with us, so, yeah.

So… so, you're saying that not, basically, not being heard…

Hmm.

It’s...

Yeah, there’s, there's been so many times where I felt like I've had things to say, I've been quite passionate about the things I see in my community and no one's listening to me, no, I thought I have not had a platform to talk about how I feel. I feel like sometimes the way that I feel, because of where I come from, has been kind of like disregarded, maybe if I was in a different area or of a different income-, class background that maybe my view might be a bit more valued than another. Um… yeah, so because I know that I have so much to say and so much to give, to not be heard because of where I come from, maybe because I'm a young black woman as well, I don't know, maybe where I come from I haven't got that support behind me or the right peop-, I'm not in the right spaces for my voice to be heard, yet so much is being said about people like me and where I’m from, if that makes sense.

How does that make you feel?

Angry, I used to get really angry about it, especially when like my friends have, lost friends to violence and I've seen, I've been, I've had that first hand experiences of violence, um everything that happened and then obviously I'm using that to derive my goal of like trying to make social change and trying to bring about peace and then but my voice isn't being heard. It's just frustrating, definitely frustrating, especially when I hear people, that don't understand our communities, talk about it, it definitely makes me feel angry, makes me feel alone, it makes me feel like our communities are just, that there is no hope, that there's, that’s how it makes me feel, there is just no hope and like in that, even in through doing all of this like, like my, my drive for actually making change, it can actually get quite lonely as well because not everyone understands what I'm doing, not everyone understands like what I'm trying to do or has the same passion, or that, people don't care as much as I do, that's definitely frustrating, when I care about something, I just feel like the rest of the world don't care, not the rest of the world but the rest of the country who knows about this violence, that and I am so passionate about making change by it, but everyone's just sitting around talking about it, for me that can just be so frustrating when I'm here trying to, I would dedicate my life to work with young people and be an activist and do all these things, there's people that will just talk about it and not even hear what I'm saying, so just it can get, it can be annoying, it can be annoying.

Um…  what else did you write there?

‘Feeling like you don't matter’.

Feeling like you don’t matter… tell me, tell me a little about that.

Um… I feel like, even from what I was saying like, I come from, I come from a place where, I feel like people from my community don't matter, like from the way they get treated by the police to the way they've been pushed out of schools, to lack of User Services, all these different things that have like deteriorated my community, it- it's very hard to feel like you matter in a society where we've just been marginalized, just been pushed out, just kind of been told like we, we haven't been told ‘we don't, we don't care about you’, but we've been treated like ‘we don't care about you’, so yeah, and I thought like that's a shared view in my community but that manifests differently, so though, so the fact that I feel like I don't care, that they don't care about us sort of, they as in the government or whoever, just Society in general, I've predicted that in fact this may change, but in my community, the loneliness and the hurt and the pain manifests in other ways, which is, which explains a lot of the violence we've seen today, it explains a lot of the exclusions, the drug abuse and everything like that. So, yeah, as for me, I feel like, I feel like in a society I don't matter, like my community and people like me don't matter, such what, I'm projecting that into something positive.

Tell me more about that.

So… um I do, I mentor young people at the lower school of my sixth form, I’m part of like different activists campaigning groups, I work with like different organizations that work with young people affected by violence. I'm trying to build something on my own and my own movement, just trying to like educate myself a bit more and the causes and solutions to the spread of violence that we're seeing today and just trying to be like a leader in my community, yeah.

Interesting, um, okay… is there anything else you would like to say about that one?

Hmm, I've said everything.

Can you talk about box three, please?

This one?

Yeah.

Um… yeah, that one was just a straight emotion of just sadness. So, I'm just feeling down, having a low mood and being a lonely spirit.

Tell me more about that, please.

Um… I feel like, when, when you feel lonely, when you generally feel alone that's accompanied by a feeling of sadness because when I'm around people I feel happy, like when I'm with my friends and stuff, I’m happy, when I'm with my family, I'm happy, but there are, there have been times where like when I'm alone, I can’t, that’s definitely accompanied by lonely, like you feel bit like lethargic, low, low energy, you don’t really want to do anything, it's just me and myself and my thoughts and that can be very like consuming, because when you're around people... when you’re around people, it kind of distracts you from whatever you're going through, whatever, it distracts me from whatever I’m going through, whatever I'm thinking or whatever thoughts that try to take over, or whatever else is going on, when I'm by myself and I just start to deep, I start to like process everything by myself, is definitely, it can be, it can be sad sometimes, yeah it can be sad, kind of lonely… yeah. If I'm just generally down, especially like, if I feel like someone like, like arguments, for example, like when I'm apart from someone and I again, I feel like, I can feel lonely, like a friendship broken down, or a relationship, or arguments of like family members and if they're not with me, emotionally, physically or whatever, definitely it’s a down feeling, definitely.

Hmm, you mentioned something, you mentioned your thoughts, a couple of times, when you’re there by your, by yourself with your thoughts and thinking and stuff; can you tell me more about that, please?

Yeah, um… so. So, when I say, like, when you’re by yourself like, you’ve got like that voice in your head that's just waves going, like you can be by yourself, but if you're not occupying your mind with something or someone, it’s just you kind of just being consumed and overwhelmed by what's going on up here and obviously that's, depending on what I'm going through that can either be a positive thing or a negative thing: so during my exam season, for example, just feeling, just thoughts that actually you haven't done enough, you're gonna fail, all these negative emotions, thoughts, just, that are consuming me while I'm by myself and I'm trying to sleep like that can, that affected my sleep, that affected what I was eating, I thought, I found myself comfort eating, sometimes I found myself not eating at all, yeah. And obviously my mind was just so occupied with exams, there wasn't much else I could do to distract my mind as well, so I was quite alone with my thoughts, alone with  just looking to the next day and the next exam and the next book to pick up. There was nothing positive I'd say about that time, that season, yeah.

Hmm, so it seems to me that you're saying that you, just yeah like, when you… what did you write here, sorry?

Low spirit.

Low spirit, can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, um… so that sounds quite spiritual, so when I'm, when my spirits are high or higher, I feel like emotion, it’s called, like spiritually I feel healthy, I feel well in my spirit like that, that can be linked to my emotions, just my, my general feeling towards life, towards what I'm doing, everything just like positive, but times where I felt lonely, I felt a bit low in spirit, as in my spirit just feels a bit dampened, feels a bit like spitting negative towards everything, like my outlook and everything is a bit more negative, its characters just not as spiritually… pumped as I normally am and that's with like my walk with God, as well, when I’m like, when I'm, when things are bad and I'm lonely as well, that, as much as I'm a strong believer, it can be, it can still not only, not, I have still felt alone even when I know, even when I've like, even though I believe in God there have been times I felt alone, but most of the times when I'm by myself, knowing that God's got me and knowing that like I'm not alone, when you believe in the spirit, you believe that like God is always with you, you're not by yourself. But when I'm going through a bad time, it's hard to see, it’s hard, sometimes that just, that hope, my belief is just blocked because of, because I'm so consumed with whatever's going on in my life right now, so I just feel alone… yeah… yeah.

Can you tell me about times when you feel that your mood and your spirits are low?

Yeah, hmm *thinks* Okay, so… my dad, me and my dad don't really get along, there was like a good six/eight months, when me and him were just not getting along, arguing, he let me down a couple of times, just a really like unhealthy relationship with him, um… and at that time I felt, even though I had other people around me, I felt like, because my like, your mom and your dad are meant to be like your biggest support system, so because one of, because I felt like my dad wasn't there for me and he was just, basically just being not a proper dad, in my opinion, I felt like alone, not like appreciated, not valued and even to this day like, even though like we’re okay, we’re okay, well, I still feel like, because that’s a bond that shouldn't be broken because it is, it can feel quiet I can feel quiet  alone in terms of, like I feel like I have a missing parent, if that makes sense, but yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah.

And um… how does that make you feel, if you're saying that, if you like, your dad doesn’t meet up your expectations as a father, for example?

Hmm… it’s heart-breaking, like it’s a, it’s annoying, as frustrating, as heart-breaking and it hurts like all these, there's a mixture of emotions because when, when we argue, obviously I'm angry with him and obviously this adds up and I’m upset with him, but generally speaking, even when we're not arguing it's just, it's just definitely frustrating knowing that like, he's not there for me the way that he should be and obviously that's just emphasized by like, that's just, that whole feeling is maximized when I see that other people like have good relationships with their dads and stuff, but then at the same time because I know that like it's not a personal thing, like because my dad's just crazy. So *laughs* I think he's crazy with everyone so I don't take it personal, as I'm getting older I'm not taking it personal, but generally speaking like my experiences and like all the arguments and stuff with him has left me feeling like, yet, just a bit upset, a bit rubbish, a bit like, to see it hurts and just not, not feeling like the people that I need to be there, are there for me, when they should be there, because you’re a dad, you should have provided for me, like you should be there, you should be like a dad, or what a dad should be, because he doesn't fit my expectations of what a dad should be, that can lead me to just feeling a bit like, a bit annoyed… yeah.

Tell me more about um… when you see your friends or when you see other people having things that you don't have.

Yeah, I'm, I don’t want to sound like I'm a jealous person or anything like that, that, I'm far from that, but obviously when you see things that you admire, you naturally kind of ‘Oh, that would be nice, that must, that would be nice, that must be nice’; so, there's always that feeling of ‘Oh, I want that’, as opposed to ‘Oh’, like it was never, it's never a negative feeling, it’s always just ‘Oh, I kind of want that, that would be nice, I wish I had that kind of thing’, hmm… and yeah, and again, so I've seen it, I've seen that feeling manifest negatively in other people but with me again like, I don't, I try to look at what I do have, as opposed to what I don't have, obviously again when in the time, in the moment, it's hard to be like that, but generally speaking I do try and focus on the positives and the blessings that I do have in life, as opposed to looking at what’s missing or what relationships are broken, I try to look at ‘okay, what positive relationships have I got? What, the journey like, what good things have I got?’, yeah.

Hmm, and when you, for example, let's say, you see, because you mentioned that you might see like other people having a good relationship with their fathers and you don’t have the same with your father, how does that make you feel?

Um… does make me feel a bit rubbish, like when I think about it, it does make me think that I like, it's not I don't think I'm good enough, it’s, I just, I just think like why, like why, what, what has happened? What have I done? What has happened in your life to make you not appreciate and value your daughter the way you should, like that's always like my questions that run through my head towards him, like obviously I never really make that known to him, but when I do see it, I'm always just thinking like, there's people in this world that like have children and they, they value, appreciate, respect, they do all the right things, like why can’t I have that? Yeah, and I just always feel like… anyways, because my dad has other children as well, it’s almost like, sometimes there is, not a, not feeling envy, but it’s just ‘okay, you've got other children that see you all the time and stuff, they have like, I feel, I feel they have relatively positive relationships with him and it's like, almost, almost a bit of envy, it’s like I just wish that I had that and that kind of just leaves me feeling a bit... down, yeah.

Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Hmm, no, I think I said everything.

What does it say here?

Down, yeah.

Okay, can we start, can we talk about what you’ve put in the final box, please?

Yeah, um… it’s like a group of people and then someone basically saying ‘I still feel alone’, and then I put in ‘loneliness’ and I’ve put ‘not knowing who I am’, yeah.

Can you tell me about that?

Hmm… I feel like, I think this one was, isn’t really speaking from anything, like personal experiences, from what I've seen across my friends, I feel like there's been times where we've all been together and we’ve all been fine, everyone's, everyone's happy, but then later on it is revealed that someone actually wasn't okay, like someone was battling with something like hidden and it's like, in a group, you could never tell, like you could never actually, you would think that person's fine, you'd think that person is like embracing the company and embracing everything that’s going on and that everything's fine, but it's come out that like sometimes one of my friends has just felt like alone or felt like just really down and it’s like that was a, you, you couldn’t see that, so I feel like there's almost this idea that I feel around people you're not alone, but you can still feel alone mentally and emotionally, if you're around people that don’t really get you, people you can’t, you feel like you can’t speak to them. You can, you can be going through something and you can be around people, but if you can't express how you're really feeling and that can leave you feeling really alone even in a room full of people, so, yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

Um… I think it's really, it's really sad, it's really sad because I'm quite an upfront person that when I'm feeling something I'll make that known for my friends, like if we're all together, of course like I'm careful, I don't want to be burden, to be a burden on people, but at the same time if I'm going through something serious where I feel like I'm not coping, I always make it known, but it's scary to know that there are people in my friendship group that may be going through something and may feel alone or may feel like they can't talk to me or they can't talk to my other friends, but on the outside, you wouldn't know that, like when we’re all together you wouldn’t know that and yeah, they could just be battling with something more extreme and like you just wouldn't ever know, I think that’s quite a scary feeling.

Tell me more about that inner, what did you…

Inner loneliness?

Inner loneliness.

Hmm, I feel like, like I said, I haven't, I don't really, severely experience an inner loneliness but like my, some of my friends, um one of my friends like battles with depression. Um… he, he almost explains it to be something that like he just, you can't even explain how he’s feeling, it's just something that goes on internally and that can't even be explained externally, like he just feels so mentally alone like the thoughts that consume him, whatever emotion he's feeling, he can just feel so internally alone and like empty and um yeah, and again, it's not a physical thing, it doesn't matter who's in the room, it doesn't matter if there's a hundred of people in the room, it doesn't matter if you got a hundred people messaging him to make sure he's okay, or like checking on him, or being like an, a support system, he can still feel extremely alone; and again that’s a, that’s an internal thing, not an external thing, yeah.

So, you're saying that you could be with many people, yet you could still feel lonely on the inside.

Yeah, I think that’s definitely possible especially if because again people have different definitions of what they call friends and you have acquaintances and you have people you trust, people you don’t, even like I’ve seen… with me, luckily, I can say that I've got quite a good support system that I feel like if I'm going through something I can tell them and they can help me, they can advise me, but I've got friends that actually don't feel that they have that and they don't, and they don't feel like they have the right system of people they can talk to, even if they've got good friends. They still don't feel like ‘Oh, they will understand me, they will understand what I am, what’s going on in here, they will understand what thoughts I'm thinking, what emotions I'm feeling’ so I can't even explain that, so doesn't matter if they're all around me, it doesn't matter if we're all together, you, the people in the room will just never understand what I'm going through, yeah, yeah.

So, it seems to me that you, when people don't understand you or people don't understand others, these are some of the experiences that can lead to loneliness… the lack of understanding.

Yeah, yeah definitely it’s a lack of understanding and it's not even just a lack of understanding, it’s a, it's a lack of, it’s feeling like nobody understands you, even though they might, it's like, it's like, almost like this dysfunctional mental processing of like feeling like nobody else will get you, nobody else will understand what you're going through, there's no point even trying to reach out, there's no point even, like there's just no, there's no feeling of like thinking ‘ok, what I'm going through is a, it's rational, I can get the right support’, it's more the thing where it’s like ‘what I'm going through is so extreme and it's only me in this, and people around me are not even going to get it, so I'm just gonna like be consumed by what I'm going through, not reach out’ and that leads to me just feeling even more lonely, lonelier than I did before, yeah. Obviously when you talk to people about how you're feeling, I feel like that sense of loneliness can, can fade away a bit, but if you can’t feel, if you don’t feel like you can talk to anyone and you’re just consuming yourself in your negativity, in your thoughts and everything else that’s going wrong, that could actually just leave you feeling a hundred times more lonely, yeah.

So, not being able to express yourself, not sharing your feelings, can even make people, make you, make… whoever, more lonely.

Definitely, I think another one of my friends, like, like, even things like having interests and likes and certain tastes and stuff that you don't feel like will be accepted, socially accepted you can feel lonely in that. Um, some of my friends struggle to be quiet open with their sexuality and again that can lead them feeling extremely alone, because they feel like, again, no one is going to understand me, people are going to judge me, people that struggle with the way that they look, their hair, just all these different things that like you feel like you're going to be rejected for, if you express what you truly feel, if you express what you truly like, if you just express yourself in general, if you feel like the world's not going to accept your size, it’s not going to accept your friendship, it’s not going to accept you, that can just leave you feeling, again, really rubbish and just alone.

So, the feeling that, feeling of, worrying about not being accepted…

Yeah.

… can make them feel lonely.

Yeah, definitely and I think that's, that’s definitely, um… you can see that across this generation, I definitely think that people that battle with like mental health and stuff, the root of, the like, the unhealthy patterns of thinking, a lot of it has to do with strong like struggling to accept themselves, or struggle to understand that the way they are is okay and that you will be accepted. It's just that always, just that pessimistic thinking that ‘Oh, there's no hope, they're not going to understand me’ and all these different things, and again, like I said before it can be for a range of reasons, like I'm too, your look, your sexuality, your way, all these different things that can just make you feel like yeah, you're not going to get it so… I have to be, it’s just gonna be, it’s just me, only I get it. I select a few people and even if I select a few people, you can still feel like marginalized from the rest of society.

Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say?

Hmm, no, I think I’ve said everything on the paper *silence* Yeah, I think I said everything.

Is there anything you want to say about anything else?

Um… I think I've said everything.

Okay, thank you. I'm going to pause the recording.

Please.

Yeah, um… so for the first box I said that the place where I feel most socially connected is at home, um yeah and I said this because at home, like I'm such a family orientated person, I love being around my family and that because I live with my mom and my brother, so being at home is just my comfort really, um my dog as well, I just love, I just feel that at home is where I can be my, be myself and just be connected to what I love and obviously at home, as well, I have my phone, my laptop, I feel like social media wise I’m more socially connected, at home is where I meet up with like, I mean I like meet up with like my friends, they come around, it’s just like my like Safe Haven where all like my connections happen with the people I love.

How does that make you feel?

Good and happy, and… just warm, a warm feeling, every time I spend time with my friends and family just literally lifts my mood, um I feel quite like grateful and it makes me like focus on all the good things in life, and it's also like… it's just comforting to know that I've got good, a good solid system of family and friends around me that like care about me, cook for me, yeah.

It seems that you like the idea of, you know, being with people who care about you, being with people that you care about, that, that sort of, those relationships contribute to your social connections and make you more socially connected, is that correct?

Yeah, yeah.

Um… and, um, so when you said like your friends and so on, um can you tell me more about that?

Yeah, um so,  well, now that my exams are done it’s going to be happening a little bit more often, but even if my exams were around like because we wouldn't see each other that often, like normally every other weekend all come around to my house, we would like play games or watch films, watch YouTube videos, order food or go out, or just do different things where like my house is always like the, the hot, not hot spot, but like everyone always meets at my house, so it's nice because we all come together, kind of like, because now exams are done, so this weekend or next weekend we're going to like celebrate at my house as well, again my house is just like the hub for all the celebrations.

And, and how do you feel about that?

Good, good, I love it, I love having my friend around, especially because after exam season kind of got disconnected from my friends, like the majority of them was, the ones that weren't doing exams didn't really understand what I was doing, the people that did have exams were again focused on their own exams and what they was doing so I felt really like disconnected from them, especially my best friend, but now we're all kind of finished, well one of, one, my best friend has one exam left, again, now we’re all kinda out, we’re all talking again, like regular and yeah… it's a good feeling, it's a good feeling.

Thank you, cool, cool. Do you want to say anything else?

Hmm, no, I think I said everything.

What did you write here?

Um, family and fun, social media...

Can you tell me more about social media?

Yeah, um so yeah, so I've got my iPad, my phone, I've got like lots of like different networking apps, so I feel socially connected to everything and everyone, really from like celebrities to n-, like outlets and like friends from across the country, to just kind of keep in touch with everyone, to keep in touch with my friends that I have now left, people are going off to university, it’s just, it’s just, using social media I can basically just keep connected to everyone and everything.

Um… so you like the aspect of being connected with people through social media?

Yeah, yeah.

And um, and um, tell me more about the feelings you get when you go on social media.

Hmm… I get mixed emotions because social media can be positive and negative, because, positive in terms of keeping me in top, like keep me updated on everything, on news and everything like that, speaking to my family members, sometimes, that I haven’t seen in ages, it's just a quick and easy way to just ‘Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah’, like during exam season like my family members were checking up on me, just quick text messages here and there like wishing me well and stuff like that, um so there are positives to it. And, again, keeping in touch with my friends, but there are negatives to it as well, so like when you go on Instagram and stuff like that, there can be a lot of like fake portrayals of reality and that can kind of distort the way you see yourself, your goal and things like that. There's also a lack of love like negative news as well, like all the negative things get aired more on social media than the positives, so that can also affect the way you think about things and also there’s like a lot of like hate messages, you get like, you get like cyber bullies, you get like trolls and stuff like that. So that side of things ain't that good, but generally speaking I'm quite careful with how I manage my social media, who I follow, who I talk to, so it's not an unpleasant feeling when I'm on social media, it's normally good.

You mentioned a few things that um, you mentioned that when you go on social media you, um, you see a lot of fake portrayals.

Yeah.

Hmm… can you tell me more about that, please.

Um, so, like, for example, with, the social media, media networking sites, where like you can post pictures and stuff, a lot of the pictures you can edit, you can do, what's it called? Photoshop, you can do, you can just do anything that you want to a picture and it will make it look like it's reality, when it’s not, and again that just like installs these fake ideas of the ideal, when it’s not even real. And then you see it in my generation a lot, like you got a lot of girls especially, might be boys as well, but I know with girls especially, girls aspire to look a certain way or have certain features and I just know that it's a, the reason why a lot of girls feel that way, a big product, is a big product of social media and what we see and what’s just given to us as for the ideal person or what the ideal look is, it can just be fake a lot of the time it’s fake.

You mention that when you see these fake portrayals, it makes you kind of question about yourself…

Hmm.

Can you tell me more about that as well, please?

Yeah, so when you, these fake portrayals, fake, the majority of them are, so like when you see girls especially like with certain body type or certain facial structure, certain hair, certain clothes, all these certain, certain, we call it like luxuries or things that like you admire, that like you want that can make you like second-guess what you have and that question ‘okay, well, I haven't got this, so and this or I haven't got a body like her’ so that could make you feel like less of a person, ‘I haven't got those shoes, so I feel like I'm not good enough or I’m inferior’ or just all these negative feelings, just because someone’s Instagram has like portrayed a certain lifestyle. You see that a lot with like girls, so like when you see girls like post pictures, they would like blemish, I don't know if it's called blemish, but they’re all like, I think, I think, yeah they fix the blemishes on their face, yeah, they fix most of that, they're all like blur a couple of spots, just make their skin look extremely clear, body extremely slim, all these like positive aspects, but they're not real, they’re like digitally, digitally created and it’s like we, a lot of young girls will look at that now and think ‘Oh, but she's so perfect, she has this, this, this and this’, but it's a fake reality, it’s a fake, it’s like a, it's a constructed um reality, so yeah.

Okay, um… I don’t know if I asked you this or not, but like when you see other people, for example, having the things, how does that make you feel?

Hmm… I feel like, sometimes it can be a bit up-, it can be upsetting, it can be, you can almost be, I don't even know if it's an emotion, but it can just be a, like just a general thought of ‘Oh, you're not, you're not good enough’, like I might, even if I'm not consciously saying it, it will be like a subconscious thought that I just have to repress because like you just see something and cause you ain’t got it, you just, I just almighty feel like they're better than me or I'm not, I'm not, I'm not pretty enough to be accepted or I'm not this, I’m not that, so, and obviously those thoughts there can just spark feelings of just like being upset and angry, just a bit like, just a bit hope, like a bit of hopelessness like, ok like, yeah, I haven't got that so what’s the point, yeah.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that box?

No, I think said everything.

Okay, can you talk about what you put in the second box, please?

Yeah, I put, for the place where I feel most lonely, I put school and again I'm speaking from my most recent personal experiences because that's where I've sat my exams and when you're in an exam hall, especially like, honestly, when it’s just you and your exam paper, it was just such a, it was a lonely feeling, it was like ‘Oh, no one could help me, I can't ask for help’, no one like obviously people are sitting a paper as well, but it was actually just me in that room, on that table, the paper, just me and the papers, it’s gonna be me getting the grade, that definitely made me feel like just alone in the way that I was thinking and obviously like at school as well, everyone's just kind of just doing their own thing now, like before there was more like of a collective feeling in the year group, like with my friends and stuff like that, but as exam time approached, everyone kind of like disintegrated and like obviously I just felt a bit disconnected from my main friends, obviously we all had different exams to focus on so, yeah.

So, when you have, for example your exams and you’re sitting a paper, what feelings do you, so can you tell me more about the feelings you get?

Hmm… anxious… scared *pause* alone, worried. I just always, you just feel a bit like, because you feel so disc-, because you feel so disconnected from people and then on top of that you feel a bit alone with what you're going through, those two feelings combined can just leave you feel like, just a bit confused as well like yeah, it's just extremely confusing, on top of the fact that like you’ve got so much work to do and then my, you’re sleep deprived, so you’re feeling a bit distracted as well. All these things that come together can just leave you feeling just a bit like discombobulated, yeah just a bit like all over the place kind of thing, yeah.

Thank you, what was the word you mentioned?

Discombobulated, yeah *laughs*

Thank you. Is there anything you want to say about that one?

Hmm *pause* I said exams, revision, grades, spoke about stress. Um… I put there as well friendship groups; I just spoke a bit about that. Yeah, just highlight some time, sometimes with friendship groups as well like, can be a bit like, with me, because I'm quite an independent person again I don't really feel relying on friendship groups, before what I have seen like my experiences of like having certain friends that have been quite dependent on certain like friendship groups that I'm in, or whatever, sometimes you can feel a bit like ‘Oh, if they're not hanging out with me then oh, I'm alone or if I don't, I'm’ they can just feel like disconnected from whatever is going on in school or whatever is going on in the group, just yeah, if certain, if things on, I don’t know, it’s weird, it's weird, school settings can be really weird, with friendship groups anyway, because everyone's got their group of friendship going on, so it’s like when you're involved, involved and connected, but when you’re disconnected and you're not really like in with what everyone else is doing it can be a bit like, can be a bit, from what I’ve seen it can just be a bit like up-, upsetting, feel left out, feel a bit like, it’s a bit rubbish, yeah.

Um, so when you're with your friends, um you might feel disconnected, did you say?

Um…

Or most lonely or when you feel like something, when you’re with your friends, you, you said, you might experience loneliness.

Hmm, yeah, when I’m, when I’m with my friends, because, I have different friendship groups, when I'm at home, like my best friends, my closest friends, like friends that I consider like family, I never really, I don't feel alone when I’m with them. Like when I'm at school and stuff and you have a completely different network, like they’re completely different environment, um this, the whole set up of the friendship is different, so like the things you do together like spending like school time together, working together, just a different, I’m just friend with people for different reasons. So when at school sometimes, like there have been times where like, like, I don’t know, one person stopped talking to another or I had an argument with someone, and there'll be times where like the whole group stops talking to someone and you can just feel a bit like disconnected from people, disconnected from what was going on and al-, because when in school it’s like a whole separate network of people so it's like what happens in the school like you keep on updating that like outside of that, if you’re not, if you’re not actually involved and just a bit disconnected from whatever is going on in the inside, so yeah.

Tell me more about the school environment.

Hmm, my, my year group was quite a close, like, there wasn’t, there wasn’t that many people in my year group, it’s quite a small cohort, um it's quite divided, everyone had their own kind of set of friendship groups, I had my sep-, like four five, friends that we kind of like stuck together most of the time. Um…

Yeah, and then I haven’t got any friends that I'd like take on and I’d like keep forever, well, yeah, we kind of experience the whole exam season together, um kept in touch, just wishing each other well and stuff like that, just trying to, attempting to support each other during exams, but we was all kind of focused on what we was doing individually, but we still try to like keep each other like supported when, if any other fell, if any of us was too stressing, like over-stressing we’d try the hardest to like keep each other up. Um generally school, school’s okay, I think when you go to school and you're focused on what you're learning, the social side of it doesn't really matter, like I'm quite, I’m a person that I go to school to learn, not to make friends, so it’s that even the friendship that come with it, like, it's nice but it wasn't, it wasn't gonna make or break my school experience, because when I was in school, I was going to school to learn, but I know there's other people that sees the school environment as like a big social setting and it’s like if you're not involved, or part of that, then it can really affect the way that you feel and you can feel really like excluded from everyone. In the second year of my A levels, I didn’t really, no one really felt, like everyone was just so like focused on their exams, so the social side of school kind of just got like, a bit like dismissed, yeah.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say?

I think that’s everything.

Okay.

Yeah.

Thank you, I’m just going to stop the recording.
