Participant number 19 – Male, 19, Hackney

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. So um, can we start by talking about what you’ve put first please?

Interviewee: Um, first I put, um socially. Um… [interviewer: mhm] should I describe the picture as well?

Interviewer: Yeah.

Interviewee: Yeah, so I drew like a um… a head, like behind where a camera would be pointing, with like a sea of faces, then I can see above the faces. And um… they’re all quite miscellaneous, so… like my idea of kind of experience of loneliness is kind of like, always kind of first socially. ‘Cause like um… where you- you come into contact with friends or family, or if you’re at school, you’ll either have a positive or a negative experience… [interviewer: mhm] in terms of that. Yeah.

Interviewer: Um… so, when you say… you um… it’s- so you’re saying that this is a face, and you’ve got like a bunch of people here, as you’ve drawn, [interviewee: yeah] and then you’ve got some people here. [Interviewee: mm] Um… can we talk about who these people are? [Interviewee: uh] And then, these people? Thanks.

Interviewee: Um, I suppose these people would be the crowd, and then those are the people that the crowd follows. That kind of, set the trends that like… I suppose then like more people gravitate towards. [Interviewer: mhm] Yeah. And then there are people outside of that, in fewer numbers kind of looking at that all. Yeah.

Interviewer: Um… so when you say, the li- the little number of people at the front who kind of set the trend, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so I suppose like, nowadays those would be called like influencers or um… er, artists, um… people with some sort of platform. That people then kind of gravitate towards. So like um… if at any, if at any time like a word gets popular, or a phrase or like a dance, those people would be the ones doing it. Then there are people… I suppose there is hierarchy in so… in social interactions. So like I was just kind of describing that. And like someone that’s like me would be outside of that, it’s like, kind of usually just watching… like yeah.

Interviewer: Um.. and, and… and… that’s… did you say that’s you watching it?

Interviewee: Yeah, or anybody like me.

Interviewer: Uh uh. And um, what happens when you watch it? [Interviewee: um] Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Yeah, I suppose it’s um, it’s me looking at um… why people might be enticed or interested in… er, not per se a way of life like that, but um… interested in kind of being many of one person. Or… or many of one, or like um, a massive amount of the same people doing the same thing, as opposed to like, um… having some sort of variation that they definitely have. So like um… I supposed it’s the safety in numbers stuff, so I’m just kind of looking at all of that kind of… internal interworkings. Yeah.

Interviewer: Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Um… in terms of just like expand more? Or…

Interviewer: So, when you say, for example, um you’re just kind of looking at the crowd and… so what, what’s actually happening? Like are you saying that um, I’m just trying to reflect what you’re saying, so are you… it, it seems to me that what you’re saying is these, that the crowd is following these people. [Interviewee: yeah] And, and… and you, or anyone, sort of watching that, observing that. [Interviewee: mm] And what… so when you watch that, observe that, what… tell me about that.

Interviewee: Um… I suppose like um… so my experience of loneliness would then be kind of um… always being on some sort of outskirts or outsider perspective. So, by default you always watch the other kind of… um… them higher ups in the social chain, whereas that’s usually been the score for me, so you see like kind of popular people, not so popular people, then kind of funny people, then like everybody else that kind of goes into that category. So you’re just kind of watching like um, people that follow trends and then the people that trend set in e… in essence, basically. Yeah.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… I’m quite content with it, ‘cause that’s um… that’s just part of life. Like um… kind of everybody needs to kind of… not fi, not find a place, but um… that’s just the way things are set up, so… I don’t feel positively or negatively about it, it’s just always something interesting to kind of… look at how it works, yeah.

Interviewer: And… so tell me about how that makes you feel lonely, being that person observing.

Interviewee: Uh, ‘cause you’re always gonna be in fewer numbers, like… looking at the social hierarchy and groups of people that are more clicked in together than you in either no numbers or few numbers. So… um… it makes me… it doesn’t really sadden me but um… it kind of um, peaks a specific curiosity, more so than um making me sad, yeah.

Interviewer: When you say peaks a um… peaks curiosity, tell me about that.

Interviewee: Yeah, ‘cause um… I suppose usually people would then try to… fit in and kind of see where they could slot themselves with people they wouldn’t find much… um compatibility with, but they just wouldn’t like to be lonely. So… I would shy away from that and kind of find my own space within all those other groups. Or… away from all those other groups. Yeah.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is, you would rather not sort of… fit in to a crowd you don’t find compatible with [interviewee: exactly] and you would shy yourself out from the situation. [Interviewee: yeah] How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… um, it makes me feel… er… I suppose over a longer period of time, irritated, and I suppose like um… uh… dissatisfied in the long run, ‘cause um, it would be easier to kind of make others and go along with those people that are like um… a pre-established group you can kind of uh, what’s the word? Kind of um… uh… um mould yourself around to kind of fit in. But um… yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And, and when you said like this is just life, or this is just part of life, [interviewee: mm] tell me about that.

Interviewee: Um… I suppose like um, unless you kind of go do something yourself, there’s always gonna be a way in which things kind of… are kind of made to go. So… in school, people are gonna be in from classes, people are gonna have come from primary school and have been close, so like um, unless you find people like minded then… you’re gonna kind of just get swept away in like the kind of um… the um… the social wave, so… it’s like um…

Interviewer: Social what?

Interviewee: Social wave. It just kind of comes and goes, and it is what it is kind of thing. But um, sorry I forgot what you asked now actually.

Interviewer: Oh no, I was just wondering because you mentioned, this is life-

Interviewee: Yeah it’s life so… yeah. Yeah so things kind of have to work, so there are ways in which… there are kind of written and unwritten rules for. So I suppose it’s like not knowing a game and then learning how to play it, yeah.

Interviewer: So when you say knowing how to play it, play the game, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Um… so I, in response to my experience, like um… a lot of this is like a game. So… [interviewer: mhm] I’d say… you kind of have to know what the rules are, what rules people play by and don’t play by. Um… so… who are the best, what’s like, who are the best people to be with, at this point in time, who are the best people to be with publicly, that kind of stuff. And you either adhere to those rules or kind of just kind of um… in my case kind of um… know what they are but then decide that um… that’s what someone else has decided and it’s better to just do your own thing, as opposed to living by um… uh… unwritten rules, so to speak, that don’t make any sense.

Interviewer: Mm. So what you’re saying is um… um… like there are rules in terms of who to hang out with and… and, and… and things like that. [Interviewee: mm] Okay. Tell me… can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah. So I suppose it works like musically. Like um… there is music um, I’m not really sure what… there is like certain genres… or like certain musical acts that people listen to to kind of um… diversify their sound, because they usually listen to the same thing and then then I suppose it works the same way socially. So there are certain groups that people stay in, but then certain… friendships they have away from that that um… kind of um… validate their kind of um… range as a fr- as a person, or friend. So… yeah, I’d say there is a lot of that. In what I’ve seen personally anyway, yeah.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying… so when you… when you say like, people hang out with other people to validated their sense of self, [interviewee: mm] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… so there would be people that would be demonised for [unintelligible 11:02]

Interviewer: For what sorry?

Interviewee: Demonised

Interviewer: What do you mean by demonised?

Interviewee: So like um… stigmas attached to them about things that um are out of control. So maybe like a sickness they were born with, um… I suppose in some cases we have people with back problems that kind of had like a slight hump and things like this. So things that are out of their control that kind of get mocked. Um… and… there would be a lot of mocking, but then those same people would be next to that person, because um, it showed that like um they could be friends with anybody, despite kind of being friends with everybody who was cool. So…

Interviewer: Um, so you’re saying that some people, for example, will struggle in a way, because of the- because of the certain conditions that may have, because of the certain things they were born with, like being sick for example, having chronic pain and so on [interviewee: mm] and so they would be mocked at or- or kind of bullied in school. [Interviewee: mm] Um… and you were- I guess you were referring to it in a school environment when you… and- and you’ve got like for example the cool kids, who um… who basically… um, can you tell me about that? I’m trying to follow-

Interviewee: Yeah. So by cool kids I mean like um… usually the people that pe- um… in a school sense people look up to, because um… they either… um, let’s say away from school they had… like a good dress sense or like they knew a lot of people, as well when I was in school it was about like um… how many friends you had. So if this person was like um… could go to the top with- with the people he was with and then to the bottom, to the people that weren’t deemed as cool as those guys, then like um… that would be the cool person. The person in school that kinda had um… not necessarily had anything that gravitated people towards them, it’s um… more so what people saw in them, and then decided they would stick to them ‘cause of… like um… funny personality and stuff like that.

Interviewer: So you’re saying basically it’s not so much that what that person was, it’s more about how other people saw him or her.

Interviewee: Yeah, exactly.

Interviewer: Okay. Um… I’m just trying to understand. So, can you tell me more about like, when you say like wh- it’s like how people saw them, [interviewee: okay] what do you- can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah so um, it would be people… um, putting them in… or seeing them as idols. And I suppose once you kind of get to that point you don’t see that person too much though as a person, it’s about all the things you attribute to them. So like wow, they’re so amazing, and like um you kind of put them on a pedestal you can’t reach. So that’s what I mean. Like idol worship. Stuff like that.

Interviewer: Uh… and this is referring to cool people in school for example.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. And how does that make you feel? How do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… ah… disheartened and then upsetting, to a certain extent, because um… it feels like that person probably is… slightly demeaning themselves by kind of um… just being the person that is friends with that person, as opposed to like um also focusing on themselves. So more about a good time than kind of um… uh… self help or like… self exploration. Yeah.

Interviewer: So you’re saying that they don’t necessarily self explore themselves but they basically… kind of worship like- or not worship, self- well kind of idolise another person in a way.

Interviewee: Yeah, exactly.

Interviewer: Okay. And- and when they for example don’t self enquire, tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, it feel like that person’s just kind of um… uh… for lack of a better word or phrase, just gone where the wind takes them. So… it’s not about anything else apart from whatever’s in front of you. And I suppose those things are temporary. So that- that person just kind of gets swept away with wherever the wind blows. [Interviewer: mm] Mm.

Interviewer: A-… thanks. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: Uh… no.

Interviewer: Just going back to what you drew again, so basically you have that person sit- sit- standing here, could be anyone, kind of looking at the crowd following the influencers, right? [Interviewee: mm] And the influencers could be like, you mentioned celebrities? [Interviewee: yeah] They could be celebrities or people within your school who could be quite poplar and the crowd, like as in the rest of the school, or all the other students or kids, kind of following those influencers in the school. [Interviewee: mm] And… and- and you are that individual being the outsider, kind of um not wanting to fit in to what the crowd is doing, [interviewee: mm] and… and how does that make you feel lonely?

Interviewee: Um, I suppose it’s the idea of kind of being alone in the crowd. So, you’re in- you’re in a room of um a lot of people, though it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s any connection apart from proximity. So, you do feel quite isolated in that sense. In a physical sense. But um… yeah, so definitely feelings of isolation.

Interviewer: So you’re- because you’re not following the crowd, as in the- you’re not following the crowd to follow the influencers, because you’re not sort of doing that, as in you don’t want to fit in, that makes you feel lonely. Or contributes to feeling lonely for you.

Interviewee: Exactly.

Interviewer: How do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… um… slightly anxious I’d say, because I’m uh… you do wonder how that maps out long term.

Interviewer: You do want to what?

Interviewee: You- you do wonder how that maps out long term. So like um… if you feel like that now, um how does that kind of look in let’s say five years’ time or two years’ time. So like that.

Interviewer: When- s-… so you wonder how- what might this lead to in the future, [interviewee: yeah] you being sort of the observer, kind of feeling lonely anxious, um… when you say future, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Uh… ‘cause I suppose I’m someone that kind of um… always thinks about like what could be next. So… I always think um… I’m not sure what the next three years are gonna look like, but I know that um, I’m not gonna kind of um… go okay let me kind of um go follow a fashion trends and go outside and kind of be that type of person. So… I wonder what, uh- how my interaction with the rest of the world is gonna be, being who I am. Yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And how do you- how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… it’s quite interesting. I’d say slightly excited, ‘cause um… um… I suppose it’s unexplored territory for me. So it’s interesting to see what those results would be, in a certain sense. Mm.

Interviewer: Mm. So what you’re saying is, um… you don’t necessarily follow any specific trends, um… and- and so because of that, it- the… the future is a bit unclear in a way. [Interviewee: mm] And- and that… in a way, can be exciting [interviewee: mm] one way of looking at it. But also as you said earlier, it can also be anxious for you. [Interviewee: mm] Okay… [interviewee: mm] cool, thanks. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: Uh… mm-mm.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Can we start by talking about what you put next please?

Interviewee: Yeah, I don’t think I spelt many of these words properly but [interviewer: it’s alright] I put um… societally, conformity, standards, expectations and systems and practices.

Interviewer: Okay. Thanks. Can we talk about them?

Interviewee: Yeah. So um… I suppose we kind of touched on conformity, so that would kind of interweave in the other kind of points um... But societally, standards and expectations kind of relate to… who you would be labelled as within society and what that means. So for example if you work a non-traditional job, something where people believe there’s no money in it because… they um… maybe when they were younger that wasn’t a field, um… what that means for you kind of continuing that. So just generally how society feels about what you do and then who you are… as an individual or someone part of a larger group.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is, um… um… so there might be kind of things that you or anyone would be interested, in terms of career, in terms of whatever, but because they don’t necessarily fit in with the traditional you know occupations or things like that [interviewee: mm] um… it might- you, or whoever’s doing it, might be kind of looked down upon. [Interviewee: mm] Tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Yeah, ‘cause I suppose um… me and a friend of mine wanna do creative stuff, and when people hear things like film and music, they think about… whatever film and music they last heard. So, if it doesn’t sound poppy… or if you’re not, so if they think of people like um, the um, they think about the person who’s in front of the music and not the people behind it. Or the people in front of film and TV and not the people behind it. So if you don’t subscribe- ascribe to uh… things at the forefront like um… uh… let’s say, and actor, or something like that, then to them your chances of perusing it are lower. And that’s- well it’s just with the generational kind of divide, it’s like um… to them there’s no money in it, just because they’ve been told that. So… um… unless you’re going down the specific path they see as the kind of only way of doing it from their age’s perspective, then it’s um… it’s a kind of conflict of interest between both parties.

Interviewer: Um… so… um, because people may only see, for example, um what they see, like for example within the… so the filming industry, you like- people around you might be looking at the… the, the actors, but they’re not looking at the whole kind of… show, in a way, and they might think oh, there’s no money [interviewee: mm] in that. Um, and um…and- and so they kind of discourage you or… or, or don’t encourage you [interviewee: mm] to pursue that. [Interviewee: mm] How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… that one is… disappointing but also saddening because um, those people haven’t per se done any research so um it is quite an arrogant point of view that they’ve kind of um gone forward with. Especially if they’re also trying to do something like that, then um… that’s when it becomes um… um… that’s when it goes into disappointment, because er… they’re going into what they’re doing blind, having kind of, maybe what they feel like they need to go forward in that industry, but not anything other than their kind of beliefs, or they don’t know about the industry, or… so that part is always kind of um… saddening because they could look into it too, as opposed to just being arrogant.

Interviewer: Mm. Um… and how does that… um, and when you kind of… um, and tell me how that kind of makes you feel lonely.

Interviewee: Um, that one makes me feel lonely because it feels like you’re the only person saying what you’re saying when conversations like that happen. So… I suppose like, off the bat, if everybody’s saying, okay it works like this, and you’re saying although it does, there are other ways that it works, then you’re the one out of ten in that kind of… in that kind of ratio that’s… gonna be saying that. There’s not gonna be anybody else- there’s not gonna be anybody else that’s gonna go okay, well I hear what you’re saying. They’re just kinda gonna… believe that since they’re the majority, what they’re saying is right despite no backing up of then what they’ve heard and what they’ve seen, which is quite small in the larger scale.

Interviewer: So it sounds like you feel alone in this.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Um… um… so because, you know, people are kind of not sort of… they only see from their perspective, and they don’t necessarily kind of you know see it from all sides, [interviewee: mm] that kind of… makes you kind of feel like it’s you and then it’s them. [Interviewee: mm] Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Ye- yeah, so… um… when an attempt has been made to understand… um, not really a point of view that’s like um extreme or um… or disparaging, just like um… some more information, um… again which is what I’ve been- what I’ve come into contact with, um… you start to then… um… feel quite… isolated. Not that you wouldn’t then um talk to people who are more accepting, but um you start to look at your surroundings and then- and kind of… think about who else is like that. And then you start to then see the higher number of people that are more… um… not against you in a um obv- overtly negative way, but like um against you in a way that they probably shouldn’t be if they are also doing something like that. So… not necessarily creative difference but um… if someone’s trying to uh… yeah, if someone’s trying to give advice or um information and it’s not being received, then... again you start to then question and realise how isolated you are in that circle.

Interviewer: Mm. So um, I’m just trying to understand the- the… the situation. So what you’re saying is um, like for example hypothetically you and your friend want to do filming and music, and the people around you are… are- are either telling you no, go into something more traditional, or that… um or that what?

Interviewee: Yeah so I- I was using an example from when I was in sixth form, it was a situation like that. So, again the people that I was around and friends with, uh… to do the course we needed help doing a music video so… we enlisted them as actors, and there was um… a lack of cooperation because um… well, we couldn’t do what we wanted, so there was that reason why we never did something… more traditional. But um, there was no understanding as to why it had to be traditional. So… there was a lot of… well we didn’t have options there for people, so that wasn’t an option, but there was a lot of um… kind of um… procrastination kind of um… uh, messing about while filming. A- again, people not, people saying yes but then not really wanting to be part of it. Um, so… you then start to feel… quite isolated since it’s not their thing at the moment, but it’s your thing… and, if it was their thing they’d want that kind of same… what you’d want- so what you’d want in the beginning with them done in their thing, if that makes sense. So… you start to then feel… um, again you’re kind of outwards looking in on something that um… you’re not per se involved- not involved with but um… that you’re not um… there’s a kind of disconnect. Yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And what other words did you write in there?

Interviewee: Yeah, I put uh standards, expectations… yeah, standards. Uh… I put systems and practices.

Interviewer: Okay, can you tell me more about them.

Interviewee: Um, so with standards I suppose, like um… so there are standards um… for a variety of different things like um… uh… something like um… so what’s um- again, in my circumstances, hair was a big thing. There weren’t many people with like um hair like mine. People usually used to have it shaved down um… or kind of had um had it in single plats. So… um… not that there was major opposition to that, not much could be stopped, but um- bystanders I mean… in most places you find yourself- or I found myself in, there was always a kind of push to do something that I felt I never needed to do. So… whether that be through hair, as I just mentioned, or clothing in um… what’s it called… um, on days where you didn’t have to wear your school uni- school uniform, there was always a kind of weird expectation that- slash standard that people expected from people that um… uh, they shouldn’t expect it from.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is um… like basically like the expectation or the standard is to follow what everybody else does [interviewee: mm] and so because for example your hair might be different to what the standard is, so like the standard would be for example shaved head and so on, because your head is not shaved, [interviewee: mm] um… you would feel that you kind of are not… how does that- how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… that definitely makes you feel lonely because um… uh, it’s the expectation, or I suppose it’s the assumption, that once all that stuff is sorted, then you can kind of partake.

Interviewer: What do you mean all that stuff is sorted then you can partake?

Interviewee: So once my dresses- dress- dress sense per se is then up to par with what they’re expecting. Once my hair is kind of um lower down, then I can kind of… join the crowd. So… uh, I suppose lonely as well, and um… uh… I’m try- I’m trying to think of the- the words but um… you definitely feel like um… uh pressure. Yeah like that peer pressure of kind of um, okay once these three, um… once these three kind of bullet points are met, then you can kinda be initiated, like it sounds like that.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is um… once you for example have your shaved head or wear the type of clothing that kind of fits in with the majority or [interviewee: mm] the crowd, then you can be initiated [interviewee: yeah] and join the group. Um… how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… I suppose um, yeah I’d say that um… not anger with intention, but just anger, because it’s like um… um, I suppose people aren’t being honest with themselves. And they kind of want you to um… uh, what do you call it, assimilate into that kind of uh… lifestyle where it’s not needed other than in this building at this time when everybody’s here.

Interviewer: When you say people…

Interviewee: So um, people- so that would be in reference to students and that kind of um… uh school social hierarchy that I definitely came across. So yeah um, I suppose other young people. Yeah.

Interviewer: Um…okay. What else did you write? I guess standards and expectations go together, or did you uh-

Interviewee: Um, systems and practices.

Interviewer: Systems and practices. [Interviewee: mm] Can you tell me more about them?

Interviewee: Um… yeah, uh I’d say so… so I was doing media studies at um sixth form and… by systems and practices then it refers to my experience with um certain subjects were… uh, how you fulfilled those subjects as a student. So… when it came to media studies, there was um… I suppose I learnt after sixth from that um, it’s probably not the best place to learn that stuff, by like um, people that were in the industry. But um… you learn that like um… what your ideas [unintelligible 36:32] or what you put the subject, but there is a way in which you do things which aren’t done anywhere else. So… um… certain things were correct, like the planning stages, but um… as I did my own research and did my own stuff, like um there was a distinct difference in… that um, kind of… how the exam boards and then the teachers who follow that kind of curriculum want you to do things, and then how it’s typically done. Or how it kind of should be done… in terms of like um the practical side of that course.

Interviewer: Okay, so what you’re saying is um… there are ways- some… there are ways in which the teachers want you to do- to… to study or to perform, and- and… and then assess you for that course, i.e. the media studies course, and there are ways in which… there are- there are more practical based um… can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… um… I suppose um since we were working in groups of people that we’d seen across the school, you d- you don’t want to um, you don’t want to in that group kind of do the whole… you don’t wanna dominate, you kind of wanna let everybody have their kind of fair turn of course. [Interviewer: mhm] But there were certain ideas that sounded nice, but um… I suppose if people- ‘cause I think with media studies you never needed to do it, you could’ve like done like English or… history and then kind of read over what you needed to do for media studies. So you  didn’t need to do training in the course, but there were just a lot of um… again uh, a lot of ideas that were said- that yes was said to when they shouldn’t have been done. Like um… uh, our group went to Waterloo to do filming, because one of our uh… group members said it was- said that would be a good place to film. But um, if we need to reshoot then we can’t go back there without having- doing it again ‘cause of lighting changes and etcetera, but um… uh yeah. So, there was a way in which things should have worked, but um there was a way in which it did work that kind of um was… counterproductive.

Interviewer: And how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… I definitely felt down- um… sort of since communication was important, there wasn’t really- there was a lot of- there was a lot of communicating so there was a lot of talking, but there wasn’t listening. So it definitely felt like what I was saying was falling on deaf ears. And then… uh… you definitely felt… uh… it was a repetitive process I suppose so, you kinda just going through the same things again and again.

Interviewer: And um… and… and tell me, how does that impact your- how did that impact your loneliness, or how does that in general impact your loneliness.

Interviewee: Um… I suppose it’s like um… those kind of moments within your daily goings on that kind of confirm the kind of um feeling of belief you have. So um… so I would- so in that case, I wasn’t really listening to- I wasn’t really listened to in this group so it’s best I kind of… if I wanna do stuff, it’s better I find like-minded people, and if that’s the case, I find the ways in which best to do this myself. Uh, ‘cause, it’s not working practically here, kind of attempting to communicate with this group, so I’m gonna listen to myself, so it’s better to just go forward like this.

Interviewer: And… and how did that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… I suppose um, uh… in one way… in- I suppose in two ways, slightly uh… resentful, because had a better conversation had have been had, in that and many circumstances, then more progress would have been made in a shorter space of time. And I’m confident that having gotten past that, something better can be achieved. [Interviewer: mm] Mm.

Interviewer: And tell me how that impacted your loneliness.

Interviewee: Um… hmm… I’d say-

Interviewer: If it did.

Interviewee: Uh… as well, going back to what I said I suppose, it didn’t really do more than, as I said, confirm feelings that I had while there. So I suppose again shaping like um how I felt about certain social scenarios- certain social scenar- scenarios. So… I wouldn’t say that it um impacted my loneliness… oh I suppose it did in a specific way that um… uh… if it has to be like that at the moment, then so be it. So I suppose I’m… it maked me… it- it impacted my loneliness by kind of realising in a sense it is necessary then.

Interviewer: Wait it’s necessary-

Interviewee: To kind of at times be alone. Yeah.

Interviewer: And when you said um it kind of confirmed your belief system- belief, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… for- so… if you’re in a place in which something needs to get done and you’ve kind of tried every option to get said thing done with said group you are in um collaboration with, then there’s a certain point in time where you can’t kind of um… uh, push a car that won’t um push. So… like um, again, just kind of finding out ways of doing something you would do in a team by yourself, kind of um… going it alone with- with reason. So I won’t kind of um… uh… force the issue if it can’t be kind of gotten without um reasonable means of conversation.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is um if you’re in a group, and you’re trying to make your voice heard in a way um… you don’t like to force it? Or, am I understanding it correctly?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: And if you can’t- and if you have an idea and you think that it’s gonna work but then… and then are you saying that um… that you find it difficult to… to- to sort of raise your point, or… or- or that people kind of are less reluctant to- to hearing other’s opinions, or… [interviewee: uh] can you tell me more about… what you were trying to-

Interviewee: Yeah, I’d say… so, if… again, there’s a mutual goal between that group, and let’s say uh… an unreasonable agree- not agreement, idea has been put on the table. And I’m not saying let’s this instead of mine but I’m saying… um, let’s think about this before we go forward. And that hasn’t thought about- like, over- well over budgeting, spending more than you have. Like, if you go to- if you go to the shop with twenty pound and then something is thirty, you can’t do it. And if that’s it then okay, let’s- let’s think about what’s equivalent to that. Um, and that’s not been listened to because it sounds like what I’m saying is oppositional. Then I won’t force the issue or my kind of perspective… or I won’t uh go down into arguing. Yeah.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… um, reluctant to share how I feel about like things of that nature. If I know it’s gonna kind of work it’s way down into like um… a- a pointless debate or a um… a argument that isn’t needed.

Interviewer: When you said like you’d be reluctant to share your feelings, [interviewee: mm] can you tell me more about those feelings?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um, whether it be… what I kind of think about what’s been said, or how I feel about um the um the people there, the group dynamic or um the idea, I know it’s probably best to keep those to myself, as opposed to um… sharing those.

Interviewer: And when you say you keep them to yourself, how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… I feel… um… I feel… uh… what’s the word? Unmotivated. Uh, if I know I can’t do what I do- I need to do freely, then there’s kind of no point continuing, if… yeah, I have to keep things to myself or kind of um tiptoe where there’s no need to

Interviewer: Mm. Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Just going back to your expectations um… you- you mentioned kind of you know you’re hair and your clothing and things, and just kind of wanting to express you- what you want, [interviewee: mm] and kind of… others not accepting it or… you know [interviewee: mhm] um… um… how does that make you feel? When you for example wanna have your hair like that and- and other people kind of, they judge you, or maybe kind of no be accepting of that. How do you feel about that?

Interviewee: Um… I suppose the way I handled it actually did make me quite um happy in some cases. Because um… um, I’m still friends with this person today but um, he was also around that kind of um people were saying that stuff. So it would be then interesting to kind of um, to go back there the next day and kind of um see people kind of get really worked up about it like unnecessarily. So… as it was in that case of kind of not conforming and um… being content with not conforming. There was a sense of happiness there um… uh, being happy about not doing what was unrealistically expected of you. Yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay, thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: Uh… not that I can think of.

Interviewer: Okay. Um can we start talking about what you put next please?

Interviewee: Yeah, I put emotionally. [Interviewer: mhm] And I have a picture of somebody on their phone. [Interviewer: mhm] Um… I could have drawn anything in there but um… I suppose like you kind of put your, put what’s- well, there are kind of um… apps you’d put on- social media you’d put on your phone that kind of um help you kind of then tailor it to what you like or don’t like. But um, that stuff is all subjective and- to each individual. So I put like um an experience of loneliness being emotional because um… that’s like um… how you- or how your feelings about something- or your feelings about a situation… or circumstance, would then make you feel like um… lonely- loneliness.

Interviewer: Um…sorry I didn’t mean to interrupt you.

Interviewee: Oh no I didn’t.

Interviewer: Um… so when you have a picture of someone holding your phone, what does that- can you tell me more? Can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… I suppose it is like a shared sentiment with people that do use social media. And I’ve started to see it recently, or should I say I’ve started to like um… I’ve started to see it more often, of kind of um… you have a device that’s meant for um… communicating without being- needing to be present and there isn’t really much of that going on. So… in one sense, much like kind of being in a room and no one’s- or being in a room full of people and being lonely, you kind of have the ability to connect with multiple people in different rooms and… everybody’s kind of lonely in a box, as supposed to being lonely in the same room. Yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say being in a room full- full of people and feeling lonely, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah… so um… um… so even like um in examples of like um… uh… form photos, just because everybody’s there smiling and in the photo doesn’t mean, when the photo ends, everybody’s gonna have like a hug class… um… scale conversation. So, again it relates to people- it relates to um… um… it relates to your interactions with people being more than just proximity. It’s that kind of um… unseen feeling or um… reciprocation of interest or… yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And uh- and when you say for example with the social media context of your phone, um, you could be- it’s the same thing, you could be around people but feel lonely, in that sense you would be connected to people who are not physically there with you, but everyone is in their box, you said. [Interviewee: yeah] Can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: So when I meant box I meant like um… wherever they are at the time but specifically their room. So I might be in my room with my phone, I might know three people and they’d be in their room with their phones. We’re not seeing the same stuff even though we have access to everybody in the same way. But um… we could- well, not could… the communication is there but um… I suppose uh minus physical…physical contact and a human feel so uh… it’s just words on a um screen, as opposed to like words from someone’s mouth. Mm.

Interviewer: Um… and… when you say like words on a screen, tell me more about that.

Interviewee: So um… I definitely feel like conversations are better away from a phone. So, when those are had more than like kind of in person conversations, it kind of takes away from the conversation at the time and kind of- or for me personally, so um…

Interviewer: Takes from-

Interviewee: Takes away from like the conversation, or like um… takes away from… uh, how do I describe it. Takes away… uh- well it’s like um- ‘cause if you’re texting you’re kind of um… how do I describe it… you’re going through… you- you’re going through a proxy to then get to that person, so as opposed to me just saying something down, I have to type it down, that person has to then read it and respond whenever they feel like it, as opposed to… so conversations are quite longer and drawn out. So a… fifteen minute conversation could have been had in five minutes had it have been in person. And it probably would have been a bit more dynamic and more interesting. But um… again it’s two people in similar circumstances kind of uh… sending stuff to each other they probably could have said um… quicker in person.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is, you know, in conversations with friends or people, would be much more efficient had it been in person rather than um on phone.

Interviewee: Yeah, and what you’re comfortable with, which is gonna be like in person.

Interviewer: And more comfortable.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Um… and how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… that makes me feel… um… I’d say, in comparison to the same conversations I have with the same people in person, it um… it is quite um… it is quite depressing, ‘cause um… again it feels like the life is just then sucked out of the conversation. Just because-

Interviewer: Life is what?

Interviewee: The life is just sucked out of the conversation. Just because it’s um- it’s just not um… it’s not in the- it’s not in the physical- it’s like um… uh it’s um a little bit too modernised, I’d say.

Interviewer: A little too what?

Interviewee: A little too modernised. [Interviewer: mhm] Yeah.

Interviewer: When you say too modernised-

Interviewee: So um… I suppose like, relating it to... well not relating it, because it is what- I’m talking about that, but um… if technology over time makes your life easier, it then makes people lazier, to an extent. So if I- if- if there’s a um… if I turn on the kettle and it turns on the water for me to make my tea, and then two years from now, it’ll make my tea, and then I’ll only need to get my cup, as opposed to preparing the whole tea. So, if I could have a conversation without even… without um… uh without needing to put more- not brain power- without needing to think about my responses more. Kind of just kind of… just loosely read things, then kind of send off like a response, um… I don’t get the whole picture, and then I suppose like um… again the conversation’s just drawn out, without um proper reciprocation on both ends.

Interviewer: So you’re saying that technology makes you lazier to-

Interviewee: Yeah to certain extent. Not with everything but to a certain extent where you don’t need… ‘cause I suppose as well like um… it’s not being looked at as a um a means of communication between long distance. It’s just being looked at as um… a… a way to talk to people differently.

Interviewer: Mm. You also said that technology doesn’t allow for proper communication.

Interviewee: Yeah, so I suppose like away from work stuff, where someone might say um hello, can I have this by the 27th, and you can be like sure okay. But um, for interpersonal communications like um the phone- or not the phone- but like through- through social media, messaging, um… you kinda… not say whatever but you kind of um… uh… the conversation is shortened in parts where it wouldn’t be in person, whereas… so like in the- in, in… in the professional sense, that’s not the case, but in the social sense, you kind of just like shorten everything to get your point across.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel? Having to shorten things to get your point across?

Interviewee: Um… it is restrictive, ‘cause I don’t like to do that, but um I’d say it’s um… uh… irritating. Uh… yeah, things of that nature, because it’s not within my nature to do that, but I didn’t have to acquiesce, so that kind of um-

Interviewer: Didn’t have to?

Interviewee: Acquiesce, so like um-

Interviewer: Acquiesce?

Interviewee: Acquiesce, so like um

Interviewer: Aqui- okay.

Interviewee: Yeah, so like um… uh… change slightly for… the kind of um… medium I’m dealing with to talk to said person.

Interviewer: So it sounds like you prefer- uh, you prefer face to face connection [interviewee: mm] where you can have proper conversation with people as opposed to having a conversation through some form of medium, such as technology [interviewee: yeah] um…

Interviewee: I would just add- just to add onto that actually, so um… we’re me and you talking now and we’re responding instantly. If I talked to… if I talk to someone on the phone, they might see that like a lot later, and then kind of respond to what they remember what was said, if it’s through voice notes, and then like um, I suppose the same point has to be made again, just to refresh that person’s mind, or just stuff like that. So... again, you might be just- you might be doing something and then kind of go oh, I never responded, [interviewer: mm] go back like that. [Interviewer: mm] So I suppose there’s not a real time conversation.

Interviewer: Mhm. Um… you put emotional there, [interviewee: yeah] um… and- can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Um… what it more detail, or…?

Interviewer: Well, ‘cause- ‘cause you have- you have your phone, for example, and then you put emotional, so I know you touched that at the beginning [interviewee: yeah] um… can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah, so I suppose um… oh I suppose as well actually I could say um… so socially, again in interactions with people that you might have a longer term uh… dynamic with like a friend or an acquaintance or… somebody you come into contact with as like um… a- on a work basis, um… pardon me, um by emotional I mean as well like responses to things… uh… that might be done or said that are inappropriate, and then you navigating that. So… by emotional I mean by your um… your response to outside stimuli that um may be positive or negative. Yeah.

Interviewer: Um. I’m trying to und- I’m trying to follow what you’re saying. [Interviewee: mm] Can you… can you- can you tell me-

Interviewee: Yeah so um… so by emotional, I mean something that’s done to you, by another person. [Interviewer: mhm] So again that’s very subjective and that just related to you. So… again per se you might be able to control how you initially react to something that um… pleases or displeases you from someone else, but um… it’s still something from… within that is a kind of um- not an objective response, again a subjective response from- yeah, your feelings about um… let’s say you’re hanging out with somebody and, it’s not the child’s fault but you have a pet and –this hasn’t happened to me, I don’t have pets so I don’t like um walk- they step on your dog’s foot um. Again, you’re not gonna push the child but um, you’d like it if maybe the child was moved somewhere else. Um you’re not gonna um make a big fuss about it but um, you’d prefer it if like if your animal wasn’t stepped on. All that wasn’t their fault, it’s just that that kind of response… that’s a more level-headed response one to more extremes like um… let’s say uh… when there were clowns around, again you might have get- um jump- um scared by a clown, then you’re more panicky. That could have been- those could have been your work friends, like, again just a- you could be level headed about it and be like brush it off as oh like that was a good prank. Or… you might have been really shaken up by that so you um- you’re gonna have an outburst on them. Again, that’s what I meant by that. Like um… responses that from yourself from others… um, external from you, and then how your response then effects your relationship with that person. [Interviewer: mm] Yeah.

Interviewer: And… and- and you have that just above the someone with- someone on their phone.

Interviewee: Yeah

Interviewer: Can you tell me more about their connect- the connection of emotionality- emotion and the person on their phone?

Interviewee: Uh… so where you might not be able to get someone physically, ‘cause they’ll be busy, or they’re never in the same place at the same time, you can always reach someone from their phone. So… although their phone might not be available to all- although you might not be on your phone twenty-four-seven, it’s gonna be uh… in your vicinity twenty-four-seven. So the kind of connection between what you choose to then actually um brush off or take on with more of a response from people that you’re close to, I’d say um… uh… the connection between the phone and the em- um… how you feel about something is whether you decide to respond or not I suppose. Again, I- I feel like I mentioned I could have drawn anything but I just drew a phone because I um… I dunno um… suppose like um young people use their phones differently to older people so… I just kinda put it there to… mm.

Interviewer: Are you saying that basically emotions are not vis- as able to be expressed through phone? Am I understanding this correctly or…?

Interviewee: Um, I’d say that as well actually. Like um-

Interviewer: Can I just- what would you say? What would be- what would-

Interviewee: Yeah, so I’d say um… so just going back to those examples of kind of how you decide to uh react to something and how that might… uh strengthen or da- strengthen or damage interpersonal relationships. Um… you can’t read- you can’t read sarcasm or emotion from a phone. So that just gets interpret- well I think they call it audience interpretation. So that just gets interpreted by the person reading it. And um it might not have been sent in that way, but it gets interpreted in that way, and then it kind of gets um… that kind of interaction goes down in a kind of negative way, if that wasn’t the intention. But that wouldn’t be kind of expressed through messages.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… how does that make me feel… it makes me feel… um… I suppose misunderstood. Um, in the sense that um it might not even be a conversation I wanted to have in person but um… since it’s on the phone you kind of have to ascribe to like um, kind of… if something hasn’t been made clear or won’t be made clear you have to then interpret what the person means and if it is- if it has gotten to that point, so um… for example um there was- there have been many altercations in my school with people falling out and… there were people kind of um, as people do, like egging people on, but um… um… someone typed something like along the lines of… it doesn’t go how you think it goes with you and that person. And there are only a few ways someone could- well again, someone’s reading that and they might kind of over exaggerate the response, so like make it more vindictive or condescending if it was meant to- and it- it might have been sent in a um like fully transparent way of just alerting someone to a fact but it gets taken more into how people feel uh… or how they wanna feel about it. And then that’s when… people can’t hide how they feel anymore. And then as I said it damages interpersonal relationships. Yeah.

Interviewer: Thank you. [Interviewee: mm] Um, you mentioned so- social media, earlier, for that- that box number three. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… just generally? Or um…

Interviewer: Or just if you’ve put a phone, did that have any sort of um… connection with social media or…?

Interviewee: I’d say actually yes. Because um now I think about it, like um, everybody has their own sense of humour, and again uh… comedy is subjective and with social media I suppose like um the way people um… I suppose I was alive- I was alive very recently, so I don’t know how people- I know people went to like comedy clubs and stuff like that, but now like um that kind of form of entertainment has changed and kind of shortened itself down so- which means you have things like um memes, or like um funny videos. So everybody- there are things people maybe- there are maybe things people can univer- universally laugh at, but um, again talking about emotionally, there are maybe things that people care about more than others, and they don’t want to see it joked about or… and then- again, with social media you have to navigate through that. If there are group chat’s and someone’s sending in- ‘cause I suppose I knew- uh, have you come across the term incel? So incel refers to a specific type of person that um… uh, what- I think it- so incel is short involuntarily celibate, so it’s a group of people that um kind of… blame women for why they don’t get into relationships. And their type of humour is quite… edgy, dark and offensive. So… if people have- so I knew a few people with that kind of mentality and then I learnt what that was later down. So again, just with emotionally, it’s about um… uh, dealing with those types of people, knowing if to deal- to deal with them or not and… um… how social media… um… well not really. Yeah, just dealing with that stuff… away from where you are with that person physically.

Interviewer: Can you just re- uh… say the last part again please. Sorry.

Interviewee: Oh, so… so again, you’re not with those people all the time, but um-

Interviewer: Sorry I just want to check… sorry about…

Interviewee: So um… if you’re not with those people all the time, [interviewer: yeah] it um- social media allows um… uh… a continuation of whatever you were doing. So you might have spent two hours outside but, until you go to bed, that conversation kind of continues. And, you may not want it to or… you may not be happy with what’s sent but um… uh, until you do something about that, it’s allowed to happen, if that makes sense.

Interviewer: How does that- how does it make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… it depends on what’s happening. So in some cases it could be funny, so then happy or euphoric for the moment. But then if it’s something not funny, um… something quite… at this point moving more into subjective than obj- objective- moving from subjective to objective like… that wasn’t funny whatsoever, then um, again quite angry, uh riled up, upset. Um… yeah.

Interviewer: Are these group chats you are referring to?

Interviewee: Group chats.

Interviewer: Group chats. So [Interviewee: group chats] let’s say you’re talking to some people or friends on a group chat [interviewee: mm] um and then it- there was- they were talking about a specific topic like the cel- the celibace group-

Interviewee: Yeah, incels.

Interviewer: Incels. And… and if- and if they said- and if they made fun of a comment that you made for example, or-

Interviewee: Um, these people kind of… they… they make fun- they make jokes about specific moments through- of time. So um… uh… so like holocaust deniers and things like that.

Interviewer: Sorry?

Interviewee: Holocaust deniers. [Interviewer: the hol-] Yeah yeah, so things like that nature which aren’t funny. That kind of type of person. And um… so I suppose they’re looking- looking at angry. It’s a bunch of people that are like kind of forcing themselves to be different and laugh at stuff that they feel makes them- separates from everybody else. In a specific way. And again your interaction with them, while being close and then away from them, but still kind of being close through social media.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel [interviewee: um] in that situation?

Interviewee: Uh… no way now, because I’m not there, but at the time, it was um… very… very- it was a difficult- it was difficult, but again very… ah the word… mm… I’m trying to think of the emotion I’m supposed to like um… but um… uh, disappointment um… um… frustration. ‘Cause um there is no getting through to these people. They’ll kind of then through time see what changes need to be made for them to kind of go forward. So um… again, I suppose I’m un- not unmotivated because it’s not my job to change how they are, but um… yeah I’d say… um, frustrated in terms of kind of, until school finishes kind of having to be there. Yeah.

Interviewer: Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say about that?

Interviewee: Um… I’d say… yeah, so just to c- just a like a conclusive point, like when I mean emotional, I mean… and I suppose how it relates to loneliness is… um… you’re either expressing your emotions, and making it known, and then dealing with the ramifications of that through where you are or- in where you are or kind of keeping that to yourself and just kind of going along with what’s going on, biding your time until maybe something changes, they change or uh… something exte- externally kind of intervenes. Or- or so you hope.

Interviewer: Or what was the other option? ‘Cause you said you either sort of express your emotion and deal with the ramifications-

Interviewee: Yeah, which would like um… either result in like a breakdown of that friendship, which might be to your benefit, or might make you sort of obviously lonely if those people aren’t there, which again is an internal struggle, but um… but yeah, that was the first option. [Interviewer: mm] Did you wanna know about the second one or?

Interviewer: Yeah, what was the second option?

Interviewee: Yeah, the second option was um… ignoring it, just kind of hoping something dev- develops over time, um and changes what you may not like about the people you’re with. Um… yeah.

Interviewer: And how do you- how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… very very restricted. ‘Cause um… well you- well, yeah restricted ‘cause again it’s not- it’s not my job to change how those people operate and what they think about. But um… it- I can then decide to not be there, so I have that option. Or I have the option to just leave it, which isn’t gonna do anything. So… it’s either do what you’re gonna do or sort it out there and then. So you kind of- yeah, you have two options. Uh… you might be able to think of another option, but uh… I dunno, that kind of sounds like um… not- I dunno, more work than necessary for what should kind of come naturally. [Interviewer: mm] Mm.

Interviewer: Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Is there anything else in that box you wanna say?

Interviewee: Nothing other than what I mentioned.

Interviewer: Thank you. Can we move onto the final box please?

Interviewee: Yeah… internally. [Interviewer: mhm] So that is how… I suppose ‘cause I overthink so it would be- again like just go kind of touching back on slightly… kind of interpret it- interpret in like a message or something, like um talking about how… or referring to… how… um- or for- for me it’s like three people in a um… in any given time in an interaction. So it’s like that person, me and them, my thoughts about what I’m saying and what they’re saying. So by internally I mean… me overthinking and breaking down what I’m saying and then what that person’s saying in conversation, and how that may or may not be a good thing. Um… in terms of it being a bad thing, it isolating me from people that kind of want um… more kind of um… off the- life freestyle conversations, as opposed to me kind of thinking about how I can make my point best or respond good. And then kind of… just kind of saying what would be nice to say at the time, I kind of just continue doing that, knowing I don’t like to just say what someone wants me to hear. That’s it yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like- switch it off just for battery… sorry. So it sounds like what you’re saying is um you might be like sitting down with some friends [interviewee: mm] and- and um… and- and you’re in a conversation about a topic, and um… and you might sort of make a comment based not necessarily on what you actually think, it might be just something you say based on what others want to say [interviewee: mm] just so that, you know... um. So it sounds like, you know, just sometimes you try to fit in to the sort of majority. How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… I feel quite disingenuous to myself, ‘cause [interviewer: dis-] sometimes you just have to- so by um- disingenuous, yeah?

Interviewer: Mhm.

Interviewee: I’m not staying true to what I am. Like I know I some- in some cases like um… so for example, there have been certain panels I’ve been on with um other young people to like help a- so this is a specific one. I was on a panel with- this was an advertising agency in central London, and they wanted more young people to decide how they can kind of better market their stuff. And um it wasn’t very… there weren’t really- there weren’t really many people saying anything other than um this is great kind of- not to say that- that that couldn’t have been the only thing said, but um there were points in time where it was like very obvious that like um… I felt like the malcontent in that room so… if everybody’s saying this is great and I’m not, I’m not being um… contrary for the sake of being contrary, I’m kind of being honest, but um… it does come off like that. So then again, looking at it internally, I am- am I then- uh, there’s a slight internal conflict between kind of saying what people might wanna hear and then kind of giving my thoughts about how I feel about things.

Interviewer: Mm. And you mentioned earlier that, you know, you think about- in your head you’re thinking about what to say. [Interviewee: mm] Um… how- how does that make you feel? When you have to think about what to say as opposed to what you said, kind of letting things to come fr- freely?

Interviewee: Um… it depends on the situation, but usually it’s quite a good thing, so I do then feel quite um euphoric about it, ‘cause it gives them the opportunity to kind of… think about- or take more time and like detail in what I wanna say. And then in- in other times when like um… my thoughts aren’t as free-flowing and I’m not really thinking, then it’s quite um… uh… um… what’s the word… like lazy and lethargic and um… again irritating, because I should be kind of thinking a lot quicker then just to say what I need to. Yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. Um… when you say that you want your thoughts to come quicker and- and sometimes you- you know, you find it difficult to get your thoughts to come freely, tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Um… so I know a certain circumstances, so I- or I think not recently- but I think about a month ago, or maybe two months ago now, I was with um… two of my close friends talking. We were in one of the um… the parks locally and um… um, I suppose it’s a- it’s a debatable- it was like um, we were talking about somebody’s um relationship, but um, they make it quite public and they are also known, as that whole group is, to talk about everybody else’s circumstance. So there’s that kind of double standard so… I feel a way about that kind of like double standards and that kind of um… it works for you but not for me kind of stuff. So then my brain’s kind of working faster, and I’m kind of getting what I need to out clearly and talking about it with more um… uh, what’s the word. Not confidence, but um… um… uh, assertiveness. So I do feel good in those situations, and that isn’t always the case, and I know that that’s like- that’s like a fantasy for me to kind of always be at that kind of- on top of um the ball like that constantly. So I suppose I know that there is gonne be variation but um, when it does happen, I do feel quite um… um… what’s the word… a bit… off that day, I suppose. That’s what it feels like.

Interviewer: Mm. Um… so just going back to the whole idea, so it sounds like what you’re saying is um you basically… sit down with a group of friends and you know you’re talking about a topic [interviewee: mm] and… and you may not necessarily agree with some of the things that they say, but externally you portray that image that you’re agreeing with them.

Interviewee: Yeah. Um… to a- as much as I can. ‘Cause I know sometimes it’s like um… uh, if I really don’t agree, it does become quite obvious. But yeah, as best as I can.

Interviewer: Mm. And um… um and how do you make- how does that make you feel internally?

Interviewee: Um… in no way actually sometimes, because I’m- if it’s not too important, I know that this conversation is just one of many that I might even have again with the same people that have forgotten what they said, so um… uh… I feel indifferent, in some cases. If it re- if I know it um it is an important conversation where um continuity matters and things of that sort.

Interviewer: Mm. Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee: Uhhh… no, I feel like I covered it all.

Interviewer: Mm. Just one quick question. Um… when you said like you’ve got thoughts coming in, um, you’re thinking and thinking and thinking um in that moment to say the right thing next in a way, [interviewee: mm] in that moment when you’re thinking and thinking, how do you- how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… mm, again I’d say indifferent, but in some- in some cases if I know like um raising that point might in some cases make a slight difference, uh for research purposes or just in general for that conversation, then um… um… quite down. Like maybe I should have said something, ‘cause again it’s not like that point isn’t there, it’s just that I’m not saying it. So um… again it wouldn’t hurt- it wouldn’t hurt to say it so again kind of um… not regretful, ‘cause it’s not… again it… it- if more so than others, more… more- more yeah. It’s more on the side of not being to pivotal, so I won’t- it doesn’t matter, but yeah if it does lean to the side of okay maybe I should’ve said that, then quite um… regretful in some cases, yeah.

Interviewer: And how does that impact your sense of loneliness, that picture? Um just internally thinking something and not being able to express it and agreeing outwardly.

Interviewee: Uh, it might mean I shy away physically from places where I know uh maybe I’m not mentally prepared to uh kind of um… say what n- say what um people want to be said, I suppose, or what needs to be said. Mm.

Interviewer: You mean what people want to hear?

Interviewee: Want to hear, yeah.

Interviewer: So if you’re not mentally prepared to say what people want to hear, you shy away from those situations.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… it makes me feel like um... makes me feel… um… uh, can’t think of the word, but if I just express it in like words, then it um, again just going back to that um, it’s an internal conflict. So um, it’s that kind of um should I or shouldn’t I, let’s way up both options, as opposed to just doing it. So it- I feel like um… there’s more conversation away from places I should be saying stuff. And again it’s that kind of internal conflict of yes, no um… uh… maybe I feel like there’s a bit too much overthinking and dialogue. Yeah, I feel like um… uh, yeah. Maybe slightly procrastinating.

Interviewer: Mm. And when you said like, makes you feel lonely because you shy away from a situation, is it the shying away from the situation, as in not physically being there, that makes you lonely? Or is it something that you can’t, that you outwardly say something else but inwardly think something else? Um [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: It’s definitely um the first- what you said first, and then also like um, kind of having that point and knowing that maybe, with the people I’m around, just because um… again not anything extreme, I would then definitely identify myself as other, as opposed to kind of, ten people in the room. So I- I suppose I then shrink into myself and then realise okay, I know where I am and um, not to say that wouldn’t- what I say wouldn’t fly, but um, it would set me apart because um, no one’s said anything like what I’m thinking.

Interviewer: Mm. And how do you feel about it when you- no one says something that you think about or…

Interviewee: Definitely lonely because um… uh… it’s not that I’m- well, it- uh, in some cases I am waiting for someone to say it, ‘casue then either I can then speak as has happened in many cases, or um… again it’s kind of oh I’m not the only one like thinking this. Yeah, so waiting for someone to say something maybe I- well I would’ve and uh if that doesn’t- if I don’t- if… if- if it’s- if I expect it and it doesn’t happen, or I expect it and it never happens, then again, on one side, the first one, I feel- there’s someone who’s on a similar um thought pattern- thought train to that that I’m on, and then there’s no one here that um… pardon me, has a kind of thought like that.

Interviewer: Mm. Thank you.

Interviewee: Oh no worries. Absolutely.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say about that?

Interviewee: Uh… no, I feel like I got to it in the end. No, no I don’t think so.

Interviewer: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much. [Interviewee: no worries] Now, I’m just gonna give you the other page, uh… shouldn’t be as long as this one. [Interviewee: mm] I’ll just take that. I’m gonna charge the phone in the meantime because I think I’ve got very little actually. Oh, let me stop that.

Part 2

Interviewer: If you, if we- can we start by talking about what you’ve put first please. In the bottom box one.

Interviewee: Yeah, I’ve put um at home with a friend. In nature, sort of forest land, marshland, anywhere that’s green. Um… my friend’s house and his area. And… studio spaces. Yeah.

Interviewer: So you put at- at home first. With a friend. At home with a friend.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Yeah so um, I have a really good friend that lives not too far from here [interviewer: mhm] um…

Interviewer: I’m listening, I’m just gonna take the charger out of here before I forget.

Interviewee: Oh no worries.

Interviewer: Sorry, go ahead.

Interviewee: Yeah so um…

Interviewer: You have a really good friend that lives close by?

Interviewee: Yeah. And… we hang out quite frequently. Like almost weekly.

Interviewer: Oh nice.

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… it’s always better when he’s here as well, ‘cause like um, well he does music too actually, so we do collaborate.

Interviewer: Lucky you.

Interviewee: Yeah. And um, I said in nature, ‘cause like um… again I do photography as well. Uh, I do like to avoid taking pictures of people, just ‘cause of legalities and [interviewer: mm] um, stuff like that. But um, and it’s quiet too. And um, his house. So I go there when that’s available. And studio- so I suppose I do more like more enclosed spaces, like away form people too. So there’s like a theme there. But yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. So tell me about like how that makes y- how these places make you socially- more socially connected.

Interviewee: Um. I suppose they’re quite direct and specific. So… I go to these places because there’s something to do. So, I’m socially connected because I’m with who I would like to be at the point in time. So I feel more socially connected there based on that certainty. Yeah.

Interviewer: So what you’re- what you’re saying is, you’re associating um… um having something to do, having a purpose and sense of purpose, you’re associating that with being socially connected. So having that sense of purpose um makes you socially connected.

Interviewee: [Unintelligible 2:12] Yeah.

Interviewer: And when you go to that park for example, with green space, um… do you- is- do you go alone or do you go with people? Like tell me more about that. [Interviewee: um] With that friend you meant- I meant.

Interviewee: Yeah so I do go there by myself, just like general exercise. Yeah like um- but um, yeah I do go with him for um… just to walk around and talk I suppose. Like we you know walk around the area sometimes. So um… yeah so both alone and with that person.

Interviewer: So when you go there alone um, can you tell me about how that makes you feel more socially connected.

Interviewee: I- um… I suppose not really, ‘cause I’m there alone. But um, I suppose since I’m doing the exercise and out, like I’m clearing my head. [Interviewer: mhm] So… I’m not really thinking about anything.

Interviewer: Okay, cool. Um… um… okay. Thank you.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to say about that?

Interviewee: Um… nope.

Interviewer: Okay. Um… and just one thing before we go- and how does it make you feel, being in those situations or being in those environments?

Interviewee: I do feel quite secure, [interviewer: mhm] ‘cause I know there’s not gonna be any um… um… unexpected occurrences. Like um… nothing that’s gonna happen out of the blue randomly, can’t kind of like kind of plan for. So [interviewer: mm] yeah.

Interviewer: When you say nothing out of the blue that you can’t plan for, [interviewee: yeah] tell me about that.

Interviewee: Uh so when I was younger I used to do karate, [interviewer: mhm] and I remember um… what’s it called, one of the senses, their children- they had a problem with their child, and like there was an altercation there. So like um, no one was involved or anything but it was just like everybody’s fault because then that kind of thing just abrupted randomly. Like nothing like that happens in any of these spaced. [Interviewer: mm] Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. That’s good, thanks. Um, is- anything else?

Interviewee: No.

Interviewer: Okay. Thanks. Can we talk about what you put in the second box please?

Interviewee: Yeah, place I feel most lonely, I basically said in the area. Like, locally. [Interviewer: mhm] Yeah. That kind of it’s a- anywhere I haven’t mentioned here. So in the… the- the estate I suppose- in the general area I do feel quite lonely.

Interviewer: In this sort of neighbourhood?

Interviewee: Yeah, in the borough I’d say as well.

Interviewer: In the borough.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Tell me about that.

Interviewee: Um… for a variety of reasons, but um… one, a lot of people that I knew went outside of the borough for uni and things of that nature. And also I suppose like the area has like dramatically changed from when I was younger with things like gentrification. So… uh…

Interviewer: Sorry-

Interviewee: Gentrification.

Interviewer: What is that?

Interviewee: So like um, it’s when uh…

Interviewer: Gender?

Interviewee: Gentrification.

Interviewer: Oh gentrification.

Interviewee: So like- do you know what like…?

Interviewer: No.

Interviewee: So it’s like when people… people- middle-class people kind of go to a area that is- ‘cause I suppose um, I think Hackney’s reaching number one in poorest boroughs, so like they come and like change the area for their needs. So there are like a lot more expensive shops for um… uh… what they particularly enjoy. So um… they also move in, which is- which again, people can do what they want, but there’s like um, there’s no- nor should they be even- but a connection between the people that like live there and them, so it’s just a kind of um, it’s very awkward. So when I go outside there is definitely that loneliness from like where the area was say five years ago and now. So when- when I’m on my travels I do feel quite like lonely and isolated.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is um, people do things based on their own self-interest.

Interviewee: Yeah. So like parties… yeah, I suppose the party scene in Hackney has increased. So there’s like a lot of things of like that nature. There wasn’t a party scene to begin with so going from zero to like twenty is a bit of increase, but yeah, so it’s about- it’s- it’s a lot of people going about their day as they do but um, yeah, there’s nothing that particularly like um… connects me to the are as it is.

Interviewer: Um… so what you’re saying is, in this area for example, Hackney, there might be a lot of parties happening and- and… and so on, but you don’t necessarily connect with them.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Actually there was one- there was one time, I think this was in the early- the early stages, but um me and a friend- I don’t- I don’t like parties first of all, so I suppose there’s that, but um he tried to get into one of these parties and was pushed out.

Interviewer: Sorry for that- is it clubs you mean or bars or um [interviewee: um] just house parties?

Interviewee: I think it’s like clubs and bars. [Interviewer: mhm] Yeah, I think so. I think they’re open invitation as well. But like yeah- like he was pushed out. It was quite funny but um, he was like pushed out of that club.

Interviewer: Okay. [Interviewee: yeah] Sorry to hear that.

Interviewee: Uh… I don’t know, I suppose it was funny [laughs]. But um… yeah I dunno. Um… I suppose there- again, there are a lot of arrogant people. They kind of wanted whoever they were with there, uh I think there must have been some like dress sense as well. But yeah, there isn’t really much of- there is a disconnect between people that have lived here and- the families that have lived here and people that have just kind of um interested for the um newer aspects of the area. So yeah.

Interviewer: You mentioned a few things, um I’m just gonna reflect them back to you. So you mentioned that um… there are basically arrogance, you mentioned arrogance, you mentioned dress code, and then you also mentioned that there are some people in this area who are in it for the new aspects, whereas some people have been here with family and so on. [Interviewee: mhm] Can we- can we talk about them one by one?

Interviewee: Yeah, so um… the arrogance, ‘cause um… I suppose I was asked if the people that lived here and the people that are now here ever come to contact. And the answer is no. Then it’s like no dialogue, or nor has there ever been one started. Also, nor is anybody interested in doing one.

Interviewer: No dialogue between…?

Interviewee: So like um the people that lived in Hackney and the people that have um moved into Hackney. So like nobody of- of those two groups talk. [Interviewer: mhm] So there’s like no dialogue um… they both pass each other with like on the street and no one will notice each other. But um… like I’d say, the arrogance comes from kind of um… I suppose… ‘casue it’s not even given Hackney- well, what do you call it? I suppose Hackney’s now become trendy. So now it’s like a we made it hot kind of thing going on. So it’s like rewriting the last fifteen or ten to fifteen years of Hackney in a space of two years, which is impossible because the place existed before that stuff was happening. So like you see like um flyers and billboards for like news publications that claim to speak for Hackney, but they haven’t- well, they don’t know Hackney, they’ve only known it recently. So they’re speaking about their Hackney. So that’s where the arrogance is coming from. Kind of um, what do you call it, like um… uh… when you put your flag in the ground and then that- that place is yours kind of thing. So yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is um, new people have come and they’ve kind of- they talk about the- a new set of things and [interviewee: yeah] they’ve kind of done new things and… and- and tell me how that relates to arrogance.

Interviewee: Um… I suppose as well ‘cause those effects are spoken about, and in some cases- no, I suppose there are- eh, uh… those, those really only help the people that move in. And… I suppose like even down the road, there- um, there- there’s the [unintelligible 10:44] park, and like um… as well as like places around the west world have been like um refurbished and revamped. And again the arrogance comes from the kind of belief that- that all this new stuff in some way helps everybody, like through osmosis, when like I suppose it’s just like more I suppose electricity being used, there are more lights where there probably doesn’t need to be any more. Like so like there’s street lamps and like floor lamps. Just a lot of weird stuff that um is… again- again the arrogance, ‘cause it doesn’t help everybody. But… just by saying it does when it doesn’t, that’s a kind of um… um… that’s what I mean by arrogance. Again, there is no contact between these two groups. This is what one person’s saying from that side and what another person’s saying from the other side. So yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. And when you say that, you know, the arrogance and… and things like that… how does that- how- how does that impact… how does that make you feel lonely?

Interviewee: Um, because- oh sorry-

Interviewer: No, no no, it was nothing.

Interviewee: I’d say…

Interviewer: Tell me about that, yeah.

Interviewee: There’s more people that are gonna be here and kind of um… transform the area and not have any doubt of any sort. I think um… it’s been even mentioned, the mayor was meant to set something like that up. I think that’s in the talking stages so… that hasn’t been planned yet. But kind of these things kind of have to be made into an official thing before they start. So you are very and clearly isolated ‘cause… again there is no… there is no dialogue between those people. Nor is there going to be, they um… they kind of exist in their world and I exist in mine with people like me. So we only come together in passing. So the isolation is from… mmm uh… I should say, kind of more and more of the area becoming like a um… what do you call it… more trendy. Yeah.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I do feel quite sad that there’s no conversation going on. Uh… again, what do- you feel like- you feel like a lot of things are out of your power, so you’re just kind of watching it happen, without uh… not that our input would be possible from me, just again no kind of… these two groups in no way speaking. It’s just… um… okay you’re new, that’s- and then a continuing debate.

Interviewer: Mm. So you feel like it’s segregated in a way. You’ve got them and then you’ve got this group, like [interviewee: yeah definitely] that have been here for a while and… okay. And how do you feel about this separation?

Interviewee: Um… how do I- um, I’d say… it’s… it’s… I feel like… uh…confused, I’d say. ‘Cause I um… again, just like doing the whole- just going back to how I overthink, I know how this has been able to happen, I just don’t know for what reason. So, and again since there’s been no dialogue opened up, ‘cause it again it would have to be external, before it’s internal. U… you’re just kind of watching thing’s change… um, not that there has to be an official statement, but you’re just watching like um… uh, a flower develop really quickly in front of you I feel like, and not knowing how- but why, sorry not how.

Interviewer: Hmm. Okay. Thank you. [Interviewee: mm] Um… is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: Um… actually I- I’d say as well um… I put town hall there [interviewer: mhm] because um… we- we do have a town hall [interviewer: mhm] about ten minutes away. And there are some events that include young people. [Interviewer: mhm] Um… I’d say there’s a um- I feel lonely there, because again, just talking about things happening in passing, there is a kind of um sentiment that things are meant for young people with there being no real way of this stuff being accessible. So point and case, I think you have to rent the um town hall if you want to use it for anything. But um… it’s been mentioned that we can use it and frequent it when we want, and I don’t think that’s the case. [Interviewer: mm] And I don’t know where you’d access that- I don’t- I don’t think that’s a thing. But um so, I think just a lot of things have been mentioned just to sound good as well. When you like pay attention to this stuff and… it’s quite disingenuous ‘cause it’s not what people mean. So that’s just another way.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… what’s the word? Um… uh insignificant. [Interviewer: mm] Because um… people aren’t being honest by saying what they mean, they’re just saying what sounds the best to the largest group of people. Like honesty would have been better like ‘cause again there is no way that you can’t get that place without renting it and kind of just imagining an ambiguous group of young people with no reason to why they’d need a place like that, but just saying they can use it is kind of just being nice for the sake of being nice.

Interviewer: Mm. Thank you.

Interviewee: No that’s no problem.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say.

Interviewee: No, I covered the two things already.

Interviewer: Okay great, thank you very much.

Interviewee: No worries.

Interviewer: That’s the end of the um- the- the session. Let me give you the debriefing information.
