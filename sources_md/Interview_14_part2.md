Can we talk about what you've put first?

I've put down youth clubs slash groups, I wrote being able, no being around others that are similar to you and being able to socialize. I feel like especially amongst the youth if you are able to socialize with other people within your social groups it's easier, I just feel like, you should always be around people that get you in a sense, so I feel like if a person from a working-class background went somewhere or someone went like socializing with maybe someone from a middle-class background, it's harder for them to socialize, in a sense that they're from two different backgrounds, not saying that it's impossible to happen, but I just feel like youth clubs in areas, maybe like working-class areas is ev-, easier for people to socialize, because they share like similar backgrounds and there's activities for them to um, feel connected within, yeah, yeah, I feel like being able to participate in games with other people allows connections to build, relationships to build, so that has like a positive outlook on... society and allows people to feel connected, because you're relating with people in your area and then again it just push forward both the idea of... ugh what's that called? *says in a lower voice*, like being socially connected within your area because yeah like you can, yeah, because there's like a place where everyone goes, where you could connect with one another and like socialize with each other.

Mmh *pause*, you mentioned um, sort of being around people should stick to people that get them..

Pardon?

You mentioned that, you know, you go there because you see people who get you or people should hang out with others that understand them, get them.

Not neces-, not necessarily people that get you because I could have friends that I'm really close with that at first I wouldn't thought that we may understand each other, I just feel like it may be easier to maybe socialize and like become friends with someone that's from the same background, 'cause it may be easier for them to connect, like connect between the two, so I feel like youth clubs are mostly in situation and areas, so within that area you may have friends that only go to the same school as you and maybe, maybe you haven't spoken to and when you are at the youth club, you can speak to that same person and then socialize with them through like the whole activities they may have, be able to like understand that that person is similar to you and then create a friendship.

You mentioned it's easier to hang out with someone who gets you.

Yeah.

I didn't quite understand it, so can you tell me more about that?

Um... I feel like, I was talking about class differences, so um, a person from a working-class background may find it easier to, um sorry, to confide in someone who is also from a working-class background, because um, I feel like, maybe, let's talk about the cost of education, so, if a parent is unable to get a tutor for their child, and maybe like a middle-class parent is able to do that, then that child may feel like put down in a sense, because they know that their parent is unable to provide for them with the extras that the middle-class families can offer and then children are going to be children at the end of day, so maybe a child may react maybe, not maybe like in an intentionally mean way, but may like... may stunt on the fact that they have extra opportunities than the working class, so that child from the working-class background may not necessarily understand or get along with the other child, whereas they would with another child from another working-class background if that makes sense, yeah.

And um, and how does that make you feel, like seeing that another child from a middle-class family can afford something that you may not afford?

Hmm, *pause*, I feel like you can't fault the child because they're children and children at the end of day and I feel like if one parent can afford it and one parent can't afford it that's just the way of life, like people out there are unable to provide for themselves and like they're always in, there's always someone else in a worse situation than you and I feel like everyone should just be grateful for what they have, because someone's always worse off, yeah.

*long pause* Ehm...

Do you want me to move on?

I was going to ask you a question about the um, about that section, when you go to these youth clubs, is it youth clubs?

Yeah.

Youth club, right, you are socializing with people that um, that you might know, for example...

Yeah.

Tell me about, like, the feelings that you might, you know, get when you're there because you said this is the place where you feel most socially connected, how do you feel when you go there? Or when you're there?

Um... a lot of youth clubs, I feel like um a lot of youth clubs accommodate from children from like really young ages, maybe around the ages of, like really, really young ages from, so from really young ages, and parents are able to send their children know that, knowing that they're in um the care of another adult, so I feel like knowing... one second, I feel like um, yeah, I feel like being in an atmosphere where other children are also like enjoying, just enjoying themselves, playing games and like having fun, allows relationships to form, because your friend may also go there and like maybe a person like, if there's a youth club in an area where crime rates may be higher, a parent may send a child there because they know they're being, they're under the protection of an adult, so children can go there and try and like mingle, and like socialize with one another, I don't really know if I am explaining myself properly... but yeah it's like an opportunity for people to be in a secure location, where they're able to participate in activities and feel like socially connected because they're around friends and people they trust and they're just having fun, essentially, yeah.

You mentioned crime...

Yeah.

And safety, can you tell me more about that?

Um, what I was trying to say was, I feel like, um... parents may rather send their child to youth clubs, rather than send them to a park, whereas like an open space, I feel like simply because youth clubs are supervised by adults and like trained support workers, so that in itself just means that it's more secure, yeah, it means that it's more secure and parents don't really worry about the situation because they know that it's less likely for crime to happen in a secure location, yeah.

And how do you, how does it make you feel?

Um... *pause*, I feel like having places like youth clubs where people are able to feel safe is like beneficial for that particular area, which is good for children, yeah.

Thank you, is there anything else you want to say about that?

No.

Okay, can we talk about what you've put here, please?

I've put um schools, but also, I've put it in the middle because it can be both positive and negative, in the sense that it allows children to interact and socialize with one another positively and negatively that some children may feel excluded or outcasted, so yeah it has both negative and positive impacts *pause*.

Can you tell me more about that?

Um... positively schools can allow children to feel socially connected, when they communicate and talk with one another and negatively, if a person's being excluded, they will obviously feel lonely because they're unable to confide in other children and like relate to other people, so that loneliness may lead to other things, which we've linked to previously, but yeah it affects them both, it can affect a person both positively and negatively.

So you're saying that school environment can make one, can make you feel lonely because, you know, there might be other students that, um, they may not understand you.

Yeah, to an extent, so if a child is unable to fit in, then they will feel lonely, but at the same time children who are able to form bonds, are able to socialize with other people, so may have like a positive outlook on schools in comparison to that child, who is unable to form bonds and like make friends, and then they just feel like excluded and unable to fit in, so like that school environment for them is a negative thing, rather than a positive thing.

Mmh, sorry, can you mention the last bit again?

Hmm, so the outlook on schools may be seen as a negative thing rather than a positive thing because they're unable to form, like socially *gets interrupted*

Um, I'm really sorry, is it, these interviews are meant to be private, is it ok? I think we're gonna be done in five minutes, is that okay if we um... *refers to some who has entered the room*

Mmh?

Is that okay if we keep this in a private setting?

Oh yeah, sure.

Sorry, I think um..., is that okay, we just need five more minutes? *says to someone else who entered the room*

Yeah, give me a second.

Thank you, appreciate it.

Of course. *noises of drawers in the background*

Sorry about that.

It's alright, you wanna carry on?

Ehm, yeah, what I was saying was that...

Are you feeling okay, by the way?

Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, yeah, a negative environment in schools may be like, a children may feel outcasted, unable to form social bonds, may feel like they're not fitting in with the other students and then that may lead to the idea of loneliness, because you're around children your age group and if you're not fitting in, you may start to think 'oh, maybe something's wrong with me', but then, on the other hand, schools are an opportunity for children to interact and form relationships and bonds, like a lot of people can form lifelong relationships from their school friends and that in itself is positive and may allow a person to feel socially connected.

So when you mentioned something around, you know, students not, people trying to fit in in school, there might be, um, issues around fitting in and stuff, can you tell me more about that?

I feel like a lot of the time in schools you have like a majority and the minority, so for example within a school you may feel like 'oh there's a particular way to behave or act or way of thinking or doing because the majority is doing that' and then the minority will feel like, um, like they may feel like, 'oh, this is maybe how society is and if I'm not fitting in school, am I going to fit in, once I leave s-, fit in in society once I leave school?' and then that just leads to the idea of loneliness because them-, themselves just feel like they're an outcast because they aren't able to fit in with children their own age, so they might be worried about how the future is like, if they're able to make friendships in the future.

And how does that make you feel?

Um... I feel like *pause* schools, I feel like children in schools can be very mean at times and like maybe, like maybe if a person feels like they don't belong, which in a sense isn't right, because at the end of the day when school is over that person has their whole life to look forward to and a lot of things may come their way that you never thought may come their way and yeah, I just don't think the impact of school should follow them once they leave school, because the school environment and the outside world are like two different things, yeah.

You mentioned that, something like um, that if they don't find friendships within their own age group and the school, it's, it's worrying that they are not going to make friends later on in the future.

Yeah, 'cause I feel like, um, schools may be seen as like a mini representation of the outside world, so it's like you have people from your particular area and people sharing like the same kind of like background as you and are around the same age group and you're unable to form bonds or like socialize with other people, so that person may feel like something's wrong with them or may feel like 'is this how, like a representation of what's going to be like in the future? Am I always going to have this like sense of loneliness because I'm unable to make friends now? Am I going to be unable to make friends in the future as well?', yeah.

And how does that make you feel?

I just feel like once you're in school, you may feel like your whole life revolves around that, but outside of school is like two completely different things and I feel like a person shouldn't limit themselves to feeling like the exclusion will last forever because you won't be lonely forever, yeah.

And how does that make you feel? Being excluded?

Um... *pause* if I was excluded...

Yeah, not you particularly.

If someone was excluded... me, personally, I don't like when people are excluded, I try like include everyone, so I feel like yeah, for me personally, if I see someone excluded, I always try include them, I don't think anyone should be left to feel like they're by themselves or feel dependent on themselves throughout their time in a school setting because it's just not right, I don't think anybody should be left to feel like it's just them and them only and yeah.

*pause* Okay, thank you, is there anything else you want to say about this?

No.

Okay, thank you, I'm gonna cancel that.
