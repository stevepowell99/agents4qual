Participant number 21 – Male, 19, Barking

Part 1:

Interviewer: Okay great. Um… so can we start by talking about what you’ve put in the first box please. Thank you

Interviewee: I associate living alone with loneliness as you need to put yourself around people to not feel lonely and if you live with people, you’re not necessarily lonely ‘cause there’s people around you to talk to and to communicate. So yeah that’s- that’s why I associate living alone with uh being lonely.

Interviewer: So when you say living alone, um you’re saying that… when you have people around you, you have people to talk to and communicate to. [Interviewee: yeah] Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… you don’t have to do not necessarily everything yourself. Like say you can get a second opinion about something you’re thinking about, whereas if you’re living alone, it’s not really a second option. You have to do it first opinion, oh I wanna do this, instead of getting some support- moral support from someone else. So that’s how I associate loneliness, [interviewer: mm] with that.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is, you know, if you have some people to live with, then you can kind of have a chat with them about something that you might- like an idea or let’s say if you wanna buy something, let’s say if you wanna do something, there’s always that person to talk to to get that second opinion.

Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. For example, if I wanted to buy the new phone, I would necessarily talk to someone to see if I should get that one or that one, just to see which one is better. Yeah for example.

Interviewer: And uh… and- and how do you- how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Well I- I personally don’t live alone. But if I was to live alone, I would… not only would I feel lonely, but I would feel… out of the way. I would feel like no one is he- there for me, ‘cause obviously you live alone. Um… and I feel like you have to do more fu- more things yourself than hel- than other people helping you so that’s yeah.

Interviewer: Mhm. When you say out of the way, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… w- w- what I meant by out of the way was away from everyone else. Away from people you know and love, uh people that helped you, people that hasn’t helped you. So you’re just away from them. You’re by yourself. You’ve got to find new people or stay by yourself. [Interviewer: mm] Basically.

Interviewer: Thank you. And then when you also said you don’t have people to um… I think you mentioned something after that that you have to do things on your own.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: What was it that you men- was it that one that you mentioned right after?

Interviewee: Yeah, I mentioned that one. What I mean by you have to do things by your own, because… we- we don’t really notice it, but everyth- every little thing we do we converge with someone else. We talk to someone else about it. Even oh, do you wanna come shop and get this with me. If that other person don’t go, you might not wanna go shop. So… secretly you actually do a lot of things with other people um… what’s that messages called when it’s not in your face, it’s just on the side and it gets in your head. [Interviewer mm] It’s- it’s um… yeah. It’s… they help you to make a decision, even if they’re not helping you to make a decision [interviewer: mm] if that makes sense. So that’s… people around you always help you do stuff you don’t think about doing.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel, having people around you to help you with those things?

Interviewee: Yeah it- I- I feel like that’s the way of life. You- you’re always gonna need people around you, not only to help you but to do everything like love you, to- to make decisions with, to talk to. So yeah, it’s- I feel like that is the best- the best way to make decisions.

Interviewer: So what you’re saying is um… having people around you, to talk to, to love you, to be there for you, [interviewee: mhm] prevents you from being lonely.

Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah, when you put yourself around people, especially that you love, that you love talking to, not necessarily even talking to, just seeing every once in a while, you won’t be lonely.

Interviewer: Mhm. Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee: Mm no. That- that’s alright there.

Interviewer: Okay great. So can we go on and start talking about the second one please?

Interviewee: Yeah. Um… in the second part- uh box, I put depression. I feel like depression is a big factor in loneliness. It makes a lot of people lonely ‘cause when you get depressed- I wouldn’t know, I’ve never been depressed- but when you get depressed, you push everything away, you try and be yourself in your own corner. For example when people come back from abroad when they’re gone to war, they are made homeless and then they lose all their family they’re depressed, they push everyone away, and I feel like that is a big part in lone- in loneliness. Because you push everyone out of your life and then you’ve got no one left. So I think that is one of the main- that’s actually one of the main- the main aspects of loneliness. Depression.

Interviewer: When you say pushing everyone away, [interviewee: mm] tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah when you’re depressed, you just don’t wanna talk to no one. You just wanna be yourself in your room or wherever your space is. Not necessarily doing anything, just quiet. And um… when people are around you, it’s not quiet, so you push them away. And that’s how loneliness comes about. You make yourself lonely- lonelier every day.

Interviewer: And so how- h- how would that- how would it make you feel- or anyone- if you were in that situation?

Interviewee: It would make- it would make me feel… ooph, probably hurt. Hurt because I would feel- I would feel not necessarily to feel that I would want someone to help me talk to- but with when your depressed obviously you don’t want to talk to no one. But I feel like everyone that is depressed should talk to someone. To not be lonely in the future. So I feel like I would feel hurt, personally, but other people might feel other ways about it.

Interviewer: When you say hurt, tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well, um… I would feel hurt, say like… not- not necessarily if you dropped something and someone didn’t pick it up for you or someone didn’t hold the door, it’s a bigger picture. Say like if I was going through depression or something else and no one offered me the help, no one offered me the numbers or stuff like that to call, the help lines, I would feel hurt. Because in this day and age, people kind of expect it. People expect to get that help. But sometimes, some- some of the people that need it don’t get it. So I feel like in my opinion it would be hurt.

Interviewer: When you say in this day in age people expect help, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Well, on TV now there’s so much adverts about oh, uh donate to this charity, if you’ve gone through this abuse, call this number, the child help- there’s all these adverts, so it kind of imprints on your head that there’s loads of people to help you. ‘Cause it’s- it’s on everything you do. Your phone, when you go on the internet, the adds pop up, your TV, um… even when you go to school, primary, secondary, college, there’s posters. So you see it everywhere and anywhere you go. So that’s why I would think people would naturally presume that they would get the help that they need. [Interviewer: mhm] So that’s why I associate it with hurt when you don’t get help.

Interviewer: Mm. And is it like, the help with- from- from friends and family, or is it help from external support?

Interviewee: Not necesser- [interviewer: tell me more…] not necessarily someone- maybe a friend. Maybe a friend telling you you can go and get help here. But professionals. Definitely I feel like everyone has that- has that professional they need to talk to. I.e. a psychologist or someone- a shrink- someone just to help talk to. And I feel like the- it helps to talk to family, in some people’s cases, but I feel like some people need a professional to talk to. [Interviewer: mm] ‘Cause they can’t talk to their family. Or friends.

Interviewer: And when you said being hurt, you associate that with loneliness, [interviewee: yeah] um… is it okay if I ask you to tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Well I- I personally obviously never been hurt to an extent, but I feel like, when people are hurt, not only do they push away from the person that hurt them, you push away from the group that they hang out with or- or the same- let’s say you like delete social media because of it, say if you get cyberbullied, you would delete the website or- and I feel like you lose so much, even though you think- you think you’re getting away from that hurt, but you’re actually losing a lot of stuff by doing it. Say like if I- for example if I got bullied in school, and um I left school, not only am I losing friends, but I’m also getting away from the hurt. So you lose- you lose and gain at the same time. So that- that’s why I associate that with loneliness, ‘cause not only do you lose the bad things, you lose the good things. You lose everything together [interviewer: mm] so that’s why I associate that with loneliness.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is um… like when you for example experience bullying, you might be- it might be good that you get away, because you don’t get to be bullied [interviewee: yeah] but at the same time you lose [interviewee: so much] like good friends [interviewee: yeah] or you lose certain support, [interviewee: yeah hundred percent] and so on. How do you feel about that?

Interviewee: I feel- it shouldn’t be like that. It should be, if you’re getting bullied or if you’re going through depression or if you’re living alone, there should always be that someone even though if you have arguments you can go back to and you can talk to. And I feel like that is why lots of people have their different preferred um person to talk to, like a professional or… or a friend. So… yeah, that’s why I put depression in the second box, ‘cause I feel like that is such a big part of loneliness.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is no having people to talk to [interviewee: mhm] contributes to feeling lonely.

Interviewee: Mhm. And depression [interviewer: depressed…] makes you push people away.

Interviewer: So having, you know, having people around you and not living alone… having people to- to communicate with… yeah, is promoting of your sense of connectedness.

Interviewee: Mhm.

Interviewer: Um, is there anything else you want to say about that box?

Interviewee: No I think- I think we got it all out there.

Interviewer: Thank you. [Interviewee: unintelligible 11:49] Sure. Um, okay, can we talk about what you’ve put third please?

Interviewee: In the third box I put the word sea, as in ocean. And I put that because there’s so much of it and it’s so… if you think of it, even though underneath the water you’ve got all the sea life, the fishes, the coral, everything, but on top of the water there’s nothing. That’s why I put that with loneliness, because loneliness, when you think of it you think of nothing. That’s why I think sea is nothing. It’s a long, vast, stretch of blue. [Interviewer: mm] That’s it. So, that’s- I think- I think sea- sea and the next box is the two words you associate loneliness with the most.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say um… you associate loneliness with nothing, can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Yeah um, with loneliness, you’re lonely because you’ve got nothing. You’re- you ain’t got no friends, you’ve got no family, you’ve got no one to talk to. It’s always that word, no one, or nothing. Them two words and... yeah, so them two words you associate with- like the same really, nothing and no one. It just means loneliness in my eyes means you’ve got absolutely nothing. It’s just- it’s just you. It’s yourself. So I feel like sea is nothing. [Interviewer: mm] That’s why it’s best described.

Interviewer: Um so it sounds like what you’re saying is, um loneliness means you don’t have anyone to talk to, you feel like your life- you have no one- your life is nothing, essentially.

Interviewee: Yeah. Say you got lost at sea, with you and a- a life raft, and you’re on sea for three months, you’d be very lonely because you’ve got no one. You’ve got no one to talk to for them three months, it’s just you and nothingness. So maybe… I associate sea with loneliness because that’s what the sea is. The sea is probably the most loneliest place in the world.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Mm. Um… it don’t make me feel no way. It just- I just- the sea is- how that makes me feel is I wouldn’t- I wouldn’t go to the sea, ‘casue I know that it’s- there’s nothing there part from water and underneath. But I’m talking about on top. So there’s nothing there. I would just- I feel like I wouldn’t really wanna go there, I would wanna stay in the big cities [interviewer: mhm] where there’s loads of people and everything.

Interviewer: So it seems like what you’re saying is uh, you don’t want to go to a place where you feel that it’s just you, you would rather be [interviewee: yeah] in places where there’s lots of people, you’re around- you’re around many [interviewee: yeah] and so on. [Interviewee: yeah] Um, how do you feel about that?

Interviewee: I feel that’s- I feel that’s the way everyone should- should um… live. They should put themselves around people, so they don’t- so they have people to converse with, people to talk to, like people to help make decisions, as we said in the first box. Um… yeah. I feel like putting yourself around people is just the best way to live because you get help and you don’t- you don’t feel lonely.

Interviewer: When you say people, putting yourself around people, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Well, not- you don’t necessarily wanna put yourself around bad people, people that don’t help you. You wanna put yourself around family, friends, work colleagues even, if you get along with them. Just people that are good energy in your life, not negative energy.

Interviewer: Okay, so you’re saying that not every people would- would be valuable in reducing your sense of loneliness. [Interviewee: yeah] So good people, so people who actually want to help. [Interviewee: mhm] So family, good friends, colleagues.

Interviewee: People that treat you the way they expect to be treated. [Interviewer: mhm] That’s who you should put yourself with.

Interviewer: And you also mentioned earlier that you associated loneliness with nothing. So when you say you feel lonely it means you don’t have anything. [Interviewee: mhm] How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um, in my personal opinion, I feel like someone- everyone’s got something, whether you don’t know what it is or you do know what it is, everyone’s got something. But, it’s the people that can’t find that something they’ve got that are lonely, that are still searching for it. And um… I feel like, not only- I don’t know how it would be possible but I feel like they need to be helped to find that thing. Not- not necessarily- not necessarily something. It’s like a um… something you was born to do. And I feel like people don’t know what that is until they get help. Yeah so… I feel like that is… yeah. And that’s also another positive thing about putting yourself around people that are positive. They help you out and help you find that something you’re made for.

Interviewer: So, what you’re saying is, people feel lonely, or they feel like they don’t have any- or lonely people feel like they don’t have anything, because they haven’t actually found their true kind of um…

Interviewee: Calling. [Interviewer: calling] Their true calling. They have- lots of people haven’t found it yet. And I feel like that is one of the main things that makes people lonely and depressed and just alone, because they’re still searching for it and they can’t find it. And while they’re searching, they push people out and they pull people in. And I feel like when they do find it, that’s when they start settling down and start living life, making a family and… living…

Interviewer: Mhm. When you say they start like making life, or making a living, tell me [ interviewee: mhm] more about that.

Interviewee: Well, when you’re- when you’re growing up, you think of a life as in you have a family you, have a house, you go to work, you come back from work, you stay home from work on the weekends and spend it with your family. And that’s what like- that’s what everyone- or, I know I do- associate life with. What I just explained. So I feel like people need to make their life, as in family and house and work, before they get lonely and depressed. And that- that- that job that they do, or that they wife he married, or that son or daughter he has or she has, is their calling. And that gets them out of their loneliness or depression. So yeah.

Interviewer: So you’re saying that family could be- having a family could be a calling.

Interviewee: Hundred- [interviewer: or so-] yeah, hundred percent. Someone could be in such a bad place, and then the… the girlfriend he’s got at the time goes- or boyfriend- I’m- I’m pregnant, and then he could be in a good place. ‘Cause that- he found what he was made for.

Interviewer: Mm. So you’re saying having a family can- can be one’s calling, and that in a way can act- can actually reduce your sense of loneliness.

Interviewee: Yeah. Definitely. But then I feel like also, some people inflict their loneliness by having a family. I feel like some people are made to just be alone, and they put themselves in a family and they don’t need. So I feel like some people make themselves lonely but some people need a family to not be lonely. Or depressed.

Interviewer: When you say some people are made to be alone and they put themselves in a family context [interviewee: mm] and that inflicts their loneliness, [interviewee: yeah] tell me more about that.

Interviewee: Well some people get married to… the wife or husband that they’re not necessarily gonna be within three years, four years. And I feel like that isn’t what you want. I feel like you want someone who you’re gonna be with forever. So I feel like them- the three year, four year, five year relationships is what inflicts the loneliness. Because you go home, you don’t really wanna sleep in the same bed, you wanna sleep on the sofa, which it- that’s- again, you’re pushing away- you’re pushing away from the people. And you’re going to sleep by yourself. So I feel like that’s why it inflicts loneliness and depression.

Interviewer: Mm. So what you’re saying is um… you can be lonely if you… even if you’re for example in a relationship, or even if you are for example in a family sort of en- environment, you can feel lonely because you’re not happy in that environment. You don’t want to be there. And that can contribute to your loneliness.

Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I feel like people shouldn’t put themselves around people that they don’t feel happy around. They should put their- they shouldn’t put themselves around people that make them feel depressed or make them push away from each other. I feel like that’s- that’s not a good person to have in your life. I feel like you need to have that one person that makes you happy, not lonely, not depressed. So… yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that?

Interviewee: No I think- I think that’s- that’s alright for box three.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you. So, can we move on to what you’ve put in the final box please?

Interviewee: Yup. In the final box I put quiet. And um… I put quiet because when you’re around people, it goes back to the point of when you put yourself with people and when you don’t. When you’re with people and you’re in a house or you’re in a city, there’s always noise. There’s always people talking, phones ringing, cars beeping, and that… that goes back to the word quiet. If it- if it isn’t quiet, you’re not- you might be lonely, obviously if you put yourself with the wrong people, but then you might- you- there’s more of a chance you actually won’t be because you’re with everyone. You’re walking through streets and you’ve got people saying excuse me. So you are talking to people and it’s not quiet. But when it is quiet and you can’t hear nothing apart from nature, you’ll get quite depressed, ‘cause you’re- you’re by yourself. You’re alone for however long. You’re just alone. So yeah. It’s like getting homesick when you’re on holiday or getting holiday sick if you wanna go back. There’s always that one thing that drags people back, and I feel like in most cases it’s the noise. People like noise ‘cause it makes them feel not lonely.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like what you’re saying is you- it’s always- like you could- you could feel lonely when there’s no noise, or when there’s quietness. [Interviewee: yeah] So let’s say for example you live in the outskirts, and there’s not- there’s not much noise, or let’s say if you live in nature, as you said, and it’s completely silence and quiet. You could feel lonely in all that.

Interviewee: Mhm, because as I- because again, it’s like the living alone one, you ain’t got no one to help you with your decisions, you ain’t got no one to converse to really. Just you, yourself and… basically you. Um… and I feel like you being by yourself or you making decisions uh… without talking to no one, I think that is the main… the main cause of loneliness.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I- it- it’s weird ‘cause some people… some people want to live alone and some people don’t want to have people driving past their house, they want quiet. But some people, they can’t live like that, some people need to have the streets and everything next to them. So I feel like- I feel like it- it’s right and wrong in some places. It’s right ‘cause I’m one of them people, I would like to go and live in the country and be quiet and- I’m a quiet guy personally. But then… say, my mum, she’s very loud, so she wouldn’t wanna live in the country. So it’s not necessarily how it makes me feel, it’s just what your feelings are about it.

Interviewer: So you’re saying that you- you actually prefer to be in that quiet zone [interviewee: yeah] because it suits your personality.

Interviewee: It suits my personality.

Interviewer: And do you feel lonely as a result?

Interviewee: I don’t feel lonely. The reason why I don’t feel lonely is because there’s so many different ways of communication nowadays. There’s phones, there’s- there’s laptops, everything. You’ve got- on my phone now, I could probably call someone in seven different ways. Or message them seven different ways. So there’s- I feel like it’s the people that live alone in the country that don’t have tech- or not necessarily don’t have technology- choose not to use it. That’s- that- they’re- they’re the people that [interviewer: mhm] are lonely.

Interviewer: So, being for example in a quiet zone, um, can make one feel lonely. But sometimes with some people’s personalities, they- [interviewee: they don’t-] they can be okay with that. [Interviewee: yeah, they’re not lonely] They don’t feel lonely.

Interviewee: Mhm. Like, for example, the people that live alone in the country- say like if I wanted to move to the country, I wouldn’t move myself, I would take other people with me, so there is people around me. But I wouldn’t- I wouldn’t live in the country by myself like just me. There would have to be someone with me. Not only- I would probably just take my family.

Interviewer: Mhm. Okay, um… thank you. [Interviewee: mhm] Is there anything else you wanted to say about that?

Interviewee: No I think that’s it.

Interviewer: Great. Thank you so much.

Part 2:

Interviewer: Okay. I’ll leave that here if that’s alright with you.

Interviewee: Yeah, that’s alright.

Interviewer: Um, great. Thank you very much. So can we start by talking about box one please.

Interviewee: Yup. Um… in box one I put college, because I feel… sociely- what’s that say, sorry?

Interviewer: Oh, socially connected

Interviewee: So- socially connected at college because everyone I talk to on social media or I’ve got as friends, I play you know console with them. They all meet in the same place. That’s college. [Interviewer: mm] So, I would- even though I’m not messaging no more, texting them or calling them, I will see them face to face at college. So I feel like that’s- that’s why college is that one. [Interviewer: mm] Yup.

Interviewer: When you say face to face, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah it’s- it’s be- it’s better to have a face to face conversation with someone than a phone conversation or a message conversation. ‘Cause not only do you… do you see the body language, you see the emotion. Like on the phone call you could hear the emotion, but you can’t see it. So I- and I feel like that’s honestly- talking is only a little bit percentage of communication, whereas body language and emotion, they’re big parts of communication.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… um… it makes me feel… I feel like- I feel like that’s good. It’s- it’s… I feel like that’s good. As in… it’s- it’s not good to just always have phone conversations. It’s good to interact with the outside world, not just sitting in your room. I feel like not only is it good as in getting some vitamin D from the sun, but it’s also good to- you get opportunities when you go out and when you talk to- even new people, not necessarily talking to the same people. When you go and meet one of your mates and they’re with someone else, you would say hi and then they would go oh, I’m going here, do you wanna come? That’s a opportunity in my eyes, and I feel like you don’t get that over the phone. [Interviewer: yeah] You don’t get opportunities with new people over the phone ‘cause you’ve- you’ve never met them before.

Interviewer: Mhm. So basically what you’re saying is college provides that space where your friends get togheter, you can meet with each other on a face to face level [interviewee: mhm] um… you can- and- and that makes you feel good, seeing friends and… and- and others face to face essentially.

Interviewee: Yeah. Because as I said, you get opportunities that you wouldn’t have got before, [interviewer: mm] if you didn’t meet them face to face.

Interviewer: And where would you meet them if you don’t meet them face to face? Like how would you communicate with them?

Interviewee: It would be over the phone or over… like the mic in Xbox or play station… this world’s a very technological communicated world now. So I feel like meeting in person isn’t such a bad thing.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does it feel meeting um… how do you feel about the tech-savvy kind of world that we live in?

Interviewee: I feel like um… it sh- not necessarily shouldn’t be like it, but it should be less like it. I feel like it’s always good for someone to see someone face to face. Um… but… but the world it’s- now it’s just- it’s- it’s quite lazy. So picking up a phone and messaging someone or clicking call isn’t too hard than getting on a bus and- even a bus… I feel like walking somewhere isn’t too bad. Like I do- my- myself personally, I walk a lot. So not only does- do you meet people while doing it, but you find opportunities. Say like you’re walking and you look to a- at a shop that you never saw before. I would go in that shop and look what they got. That’s a opportunity. And you could take one of your mates there. [Interviewer: mm] So I feel like… I feel like technology’s a good thing, in certain aspects, but it’s a bad thing in others. Definitely.

Interviewer: You mentioned laziness. Can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Yeah. Um… I- I don’t necessarily think the older generation, but I feel like the newer generation is- is on the lazy side. Not many people’s pushing them to do the things that they want to do or encouraging them, should I say, to do stuff. People nowadays just… wake up- especially some of the people I know, they wake up, turn on their console and they’re on it all day. Go to sleep, wake up, do the same. In my personal opinion, that’s not living, that’s just… sleeping and- and waking. [Interviewer: mm] In my personal opinion, waking- uh living is waking up, going out, meeting people, having a good day, coming home, going to bed. [Interviewer: mm] So I feel like… um… laziness. Laziness is a big- is a big aspect to today’s generation.

Interviewer: Mm. How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: I feel like people shouldn’t be lazy. I feel like there’s no point in being lazy. You don’t gain nothing out of it. I know it’s easier to do [interviewer: mm] than not being, but where are you gonna be in the future by being lazy now? And me personally, I’m not lazy, I’ve been training to do lots of stuff for many years. And… I could- I couldn’t think of um… living another way. I couldn’t think of being lazy every day or not going out. Even going to play football, you meet people, so… I feel like laziness, it’s not needed. People shouldn’t be lazy.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. Thank you. Um, is there anything else you want to say?

Interviewee: No, I think that’s it for now.

Interviewer: Okay. Shall we move onto the next one?

Interviewee: Yup.

Interviewer: Thanks.

Interviewee: Um in box two I put something that corresponds with what I put in box one. I feel like, as it- it also corre- corresponds with the word laziness. As in, I feel most lonely when I’m in my bedroom alone. Because I’m not talking to no one, I’m not out, I’m not making opportunities for myself, I’m not finding out new things about the world, I’m just not doing nothing in my room. And I feel like that is where I feel most lonely. Not only because there’s not people there, because I’m not doing nothing to… to uh… to benefit myself. I’m not- sitting in your bed, just on your phone watching YouTube or on Instagram, that’s not beneficial to you. Going out, seeing people, showing your face, that’s beneficial. So I feel like that’s- that- that’s where I feel most lonely. In my bedroom.

Interviewer: And so when you’re on your own, in your bedroom, um… and h- how- how does that make you feel? When you have nothing to do, or you’re not doing much, that you feel like is beneficial for you.

Interviewee: It’s definitely not beneficial, ‘cause when- when you’ve got nothing on your mind, when you’re just- when you’re bored, when you’re in your room doing nothing, it makes you want to sleep, because you wanna pass the time. It makes you want to… eat. It just- it makes you think of the lazy stuff to do. It makes you think of the stuff that don’t benefit you in the long run. It may benefit you there and then, but not in the long run. So I feel- I- I personally think the bedroom is the lonely- loneliest spot.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is um… you always wanna do something beneficial, [interviewee: yeah] you always generally speaking want to have people around you to talk to [interviewee: mhm] um…

Interviewee: If I was lazy and if I didn’t want to make opportunities for myself, I personally wouldn’t have signed up for this interview. But because I am- not necessarily I, but because I wanna benefit myself and- not necessarily make opportunities for myself, but just show- show that I’m not laying down in my bed and- that’s why I signed up to this. Because… if- if I didn’t I’d probably be at home right now in my bedroom.

Interviewer: Mm. Um… okay. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that?

Interviewee: Um… not necessarily. Just, I always feel like it’s good to have someone s- not necessarily sleeping in a bedroom with you but sharing a bedroom. So you’re not in a bedroom by yourself. I feel like when there’s two people in a bedroom, then you can actually talk to someone and- you’re still not making a ben- like the… the opportunities you are when you go out, but you’re still making- you’re not being lazy. So I feel like that is- that’s also another good point to add on to that. But other than that…

Interviewer: Um… so you’re saying that basically, when you’re on your own in your bed and you’ve got nothing- no one to have with you- to share the bed with you, that’s when you feel lonely.

Interviewee: Not necessarily share the bed, but even share the room. Just someone sitting on another bed or… you won’t feel lonely to the point of you can turn around and go so how was your day, what’s- what’s your plans for tomorrow. [Interviewer: mm] If you was by yourself, you couldn’t turn to someone and go how was your day. You’re thinking that all to yourself [interviewer: mm] and then you’re thinking well my day was quite lonely because I’ve been sitting here all day doing nothing. Just eating and laying down. So I feel like definitely the bedroom’s the worst- [interviewer: mm] the worst place.

Interviewer: And uh, I don’t know if I asked you this or not, but how do you feel about that? Being in your bedroom alone and saying that your bedroom is the worst for loneliness?

Interviewee: I’m passionate about that. I’m definitely passionate about it. Because that’s- that’s- that’s how I live. I wake up, I’m out of my bedroom. I’ll leave- I get in the shower and go downstairs. I will only go back in the bedroom unless I- if I need something for my bedroom or unless I’m going to sleep. [Interviewer: mm] Because, as I said, you don’t- you don’t benefit from being in your bedroom. You benefit from being out of it. [Interviewer: mm] So I’m passionate about that statement.

Interviewer: Mhm. Okay. Is there anything else you want to say?

Interviewee: No I think- I think that’s all of it probably for that box.

Interviewer: Thank you very much.

Interviewee: You’re welcome.
