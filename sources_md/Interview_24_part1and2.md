Participant number 24 – Female, 18, Hackney

Part 1:

Interviewer: Can we start by talking about what you put first please.

Interviewee: ‘Kay, so in the first box, I drew like a field. Or a hill. And on the hill you have groups of friends and- but you also have someone that’s alone. And like as you can see on the images, I labelled it like the person that’s alone and then the groups of friends that’s around them, and I said I associate not having friends with loneliness because like, around you, when you see other people, it makes you sad because like you can see everyone having fun and you’re just there left alone and that will make people feel lonely. [Interviewer: mm] Seeing other people all together.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel?

Interviewee: If- how does that make me feel if it was me [interviewer: mm] in that situation? Um… like, I wouldn’t wanna be there. I would wanna move away from there. I would wanna like- ‘cause I wouldn’t want people to see me alone. So I wouldn’t wanna stay there, if that was me.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like what you’re saying is, you know, being alone is when, you know, when everyone is together and you’re kind of excluded, [interviewee: yeah] you’re separated, you’re on your own. [Interviewee: mhm] And um… okay. And uh… and tell me more about um… um this person here.

Interviewee: This person here. [Interviewer: yeah] So the person in the middle who’s alone, that’s like- they don’t have friends. They don’t have anyone around them. And they’re just sitting there, alone. [Interviewer: mhm] But then all these other people came together and they’re not alone, they have their groups of friends, and they’re enjoying theirself [interviewer: mhm] whilst that person’s there.

Interviewer: When you say they’re enjoying themselves whilst that person’s there, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um… so enjoying themselves, as in… like playing games together, sports, like laughing and joking. And the person here in the middle, hearing the laughing and joking, that makes them feel left out as well. Because they’re probably thinking oh they’re having fun, like I wanna be having fun as well. [Interviewer: mm] And yeah, that’s it really for the first one.

Interviewer: And how would this person feel for example being left out and not wi- with these other people in their group?

Interviewee: Um, probably sad, like um… jealous… jealousy definitely because seeing them all together would make them wish they could have the same thing. [Interviewer: mm] Um… and yeah. That’s it really.

Interviewer: Oh so this person’s seeing other people here being together and him or her not being present with them makes him or her feel jealous.

Interviewee: Yeah. Like feel jealous because they don’t have that sort of bond with anyone, like right now. They’re there alone [interviewer: mhm] and they- obviously, you wouldn’t wanna be alone. You would wanna be with other people if [interviewer: mm] you’re out, at a park. Who goes to a park alone?

Interviewer: Mm. So being excluded and sort of separated from friends, or a group of- yeah, a group of friends, as you wrote here, [interviewee: mhm] is basically um what you associate with the experience of loneliness.

Interviewee: Mhm.

Interviewer: Um, is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: No, that- no.

Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Um, can we start by talking about what you put in the second box please?

Interviewee: Yeah. So in the second box I just wrote homeless. Because I think homeless people sometimes feel lonely. Because most homeless people- well I’m not saying all, but some people are homeless because they didn’t have like a good past. Like they probably, done drugs, got sent to prison, then they couldn’t get their life back on track. And normally people like that, they don’t have people supporting them. So they kind of get left in the dark alone [interviewer: mm] and that’s definitely being lonely.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say being left in the dark, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like, left in the dark as in they’re there on a street. They have to just find a little space anywhere in this big country to sleep and to- obviously they’re just there in the dark, alone.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like what you’re saying is um homeless people are lonely because they are not um- they must have done something in their past, like drugs or whatever…

Interviewee: Yeah. They must have done like… something in the past that made them like- something in the past that was bad, to make people like not want to be with them anymore. So like for example, say if someone got arrested for murder or they got arrested for taking drugs, normally… some people like don’t always support them. Some people do but in some cases they don’t. So that’s why people end up homeless. Because some people won’t wanna give a job to a rapist because like why would you wanna give a job to a rapist. Some people don’t like that. So that’s why they end up homeless. Because they can- they struggle to get jobs and get money and- so I guess that’s being lonely. Yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is um… um… um… someone like a homeless person um who’s unemployed, you said uh they can’t connect with people because they don’t have a- un- because they’re unemployed and things. Did you say something like that?

Interviewee: Not because they’re not employed, mainly because like, it’s just them str- like they’ve done- they’ve had a bad turn over in their life, and they’re struggling to um come back [interviewer: mm] from that turn over. So that’s why they- like yeah.

Interviewer: So it sounds like what you’re saying is because- yeah, because of their past, [interviewee: mhm] because of what they’ve done to society and things like that, people don’t want to hang out with them.

Interviewee: Yeah. That’s… that happens sometimes [unintelligible 6:32].

Interviewer: And how would that make them feel?

Interviewee: I mean… it would make them- I think they would feel angry at theirselves, and regret the things they done. Because like they can’t come back from it now.

Interviewer: Mm. And um… and when you said employment [unintelligible 6:54], can you tell me more about that. You mentioned something-

Interviewee: Employment? Um… em- the employment just links to like the homelessness part and- because they- some people don’t really have a social life, they just go work and that’s where they like… communicate with people and um like have their whatever- speak to people as well. ‘Cause some people literally just work all their time and don’t have time to do that so… that also could make people feel like lonely because work is a place where people communicate, like make jokes, as well as work kind of stuff.

Interviewer: Mm. Um… is that linked to homelessness? Or is that something…

Interviewee: I mean, it is kind of because sometimes like- in this case we’re talking about a homeless person, they wouldn’t be able to get that job so then- that then would make them feel like pushed away like… they would think to theirself don’t I deserve a second chance or something? [Interviewer: mm] And yeah.

Interviewer: When you say pushed away, tell me more about that.

Interruption

Interviewer: So when you say being pushed away from society, can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Um… pushed away like um… no one offering you jobs, no one like giving you a chance. So all around you like jobs, your family, like everyone just turned- turning- turning you down. [Interviewer: mm] Not giving you second chances.

Interviewer: Mm. And I don’t know if I asked you this or not, but like if- if you were in that situation, [interviewee: mhm] how would that make you feel, being turned away from family and society and all that? Friends-

Interviewee: Um… it would make you feel really sad. Like depressed. That would make me- I don’t know. Like I wouldn’t wanna be- you would feel lost away like… you have nothing. Probably like helpless. Like useless. Because you can’t get a job, you haven’t got a house, no one’s supporting you, you’re doing everything by yourself.

Interviewer: Mm. You mentioned lost. Tell me more.

Interviewee: Lost like as in you don’t know what else to do now. Like you’re given up with yourself. You don’t know- because you’ve tried to get a job, you’ve tried for support from family but no one’s helping you. So then you feel lonely. [Interviewer: mm] ‘Cause of that.

Interviewer: Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: No, that’s alright.

Interviewer: Thank you. Um… can we start by talking about what you put in the third box please?

Interviewee: In the third box I just wrote not having a phone. But this links a lot to like loneliness because many people like- even me, like when I haven’t had a phone, sometimes I feel so lost because… a lot of communication happens through it on so- on social media. Like Snapchat, Instagram and stuff. And to be honest, I don’t think- I feel like people are so glued to their phones that sometimes people stay inside all day and the only sort of communication and bonding will happen through the phone. But if you didn’t have one, you would feel like oh, what am I missing out on? ‘Cause like no one’s coming to see you, it’s just everything’s happening here, [interviewer: mm] on the phone. And yeah. So not having it could make you feel like lonely because… you’re not involved in what’s happening on it. You don’t know.

Interviewer: Mm. And how would that make you feel? Not being able to be involved in what’s going on.

Interviewee: It would just make me feel like… makes me feel left out kind of. ‘Cause when I haven’t had a phone before, it just makes me feel angry. ‘Cause… it’s just like… it’s like a hobby. It’s like people get addicted to phones sometimes, so when you’re not having it, it’s like you feel there’s a lot that you’re missing out on.

Interviewer: You mentioned a couple things. Um… that um… there’s a lot that you feel like you’re missing out if you don’t have your phone, [interviewee: mhm] and you- that you also said that, you know, you- you get addicted to your phone, and-

Interviewee: Yeah some people do. Like, ‘cause once, say if it breaks or something, some people- the reactions some people have will be like, they’ll start crying or something because they don’t have their phone there to like um… communicate people or whatever, so they feel left out, like I said before.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel? Feeling left out.

Interviewee: Feeling left out? Makes me feel unwanted. Um… like it makes you question yourself. Um… like, does anyone like me? But not in this case. Like being left out in other cir- like other cases, you would question yourself. Like what- doesn’t anyone like me? [Interviewer: mm] Sort of questions you would ask yourself.

Interviewer: And then you also mentioned… sort of… feeling like you- like not knowing what’s going on. So you don’t have your phone [interviewee: mhm] or not having your phone makes you feel like you’re not- you don’t know what’s going on. [Interviewee: yeah, um…] When you say you don’t know what’s going on…

Interviewee: Yeah, ‘cause you don’t know like what everyone’s- what’s- not the gossip but what’s the talk of the- like what’s everyone talking about, what’s happening. Because sometimes, say if we’re going out- say if people are going out somewhere, you’d say do you wanna like meet up or something. But you’d say it through your phone. That’s where all the thing happens. So you miss out on a lot of things when you don’t have a phone.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay, so sounds like what you’re saying is not having your phone makes you feel like you’re missing out on what’s going on, you’re not able to message your friends [interviewee: mhm] and things. So it makes you feel limited in a way.

Interviewee: Yeah that’s- that’s a good one, [Interviewer: mm] a good way to describe it.

Interviewer: And how does that make you feel being- being limited in that sense?

Interviewee: Sometimes it’s like… it’s really annoying because you’ll… you’ll have to find another way to communicate. Like say if you don’t want to go out, but you would just communicate through your phone. [Interviewer: mm] So like you would feel stressed like…. oh, I don’t- why can’t I just have my phone, I can’t be bothered to go there or do this. If I had my phone I could just call them.

Interviewer: Mm. Thank you. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: No. Not…

Interviewer: Okay. Can we talk about the fourth box please?

Interviewee: Okay, so the fourth box is… a picture of a house and there’s someone in the window. And it’s- I wrote antisocial, staying home and like not communicating with people makes you lose bonds with people and then that then will make you lonely because you’re not making an effort to like communicate or bond with your friends. So like eventually they’re gonna stop trying, and you’re gonna make yourself be lonely by not wanting to leave your house and go spend time with your friends and family and stuff.

Interviewer: So… so it sounds like what you’re- okay, I’m just gonna try and read what you said here. Antisocial, staying home, not communicating with people makes you lose [interviewee: like bonds] bonds. [Interviewee: mhm] So… sort of staying at home [interviewee: mhm] and not making the effort [interviewee: yeah] can- can contribute [interviewee: mhm] to feeling lonely.

Interviewee: Yeah. Because like you do fr- things with your friends and like once- if you stay home and you stop going, like sometimes, eventually, they’re just gonna stop trying to like meet up with you. And then you’ll see them doing it with other people, then you might feel left out but… the person for staying home, they might have reasons and stuff. So [interviewer: mm] you’d never know.

Interviewer: So when you say when you see your friends [interviewee: mhm] and you feel left out… can you tell me more?

Interviewee: Um. It’s kind of like this- the first box, what we was talking about. But… it’s just like the person brought it on theirself because they didn’t wanna leave their house. So their friends obviously asked other friends and like seeing them together will make them think oh, like maybe I should have went with them or… oh I wish I went. Because you’re seeing them have fun [interviewer: mm] and you’re regretting that you didn’t go. And you’re just being like antisocial, not wanting to make an effort with your friends.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. So it sounds like um… like you might regret- or someone in that situation might regret not kind of making the effort to get together with friends and- and so being at home for example, or not being with friends out [interviewee: mhm] can make one feel lonely. [Interviewee: yeah] And when you said like seeing friends, and them being together, um… can you tell me more? When you say seeing your friends?

Interviewee: Oh. Like, say if they go out for a meal or go cinema or like doing fun activities together. [Interviewer: mm] Like what you would normally do on a weekend or something. Yeah.

Interviewer: And then how did that make you feel, seeing them?

Interviewee: Seeing them would make you feel like left out and lonely because- and angry at yourself because you was being antisocial and stubborn, not wanting to try to make an effort, but it just backfired because they have other options and now… they’re not gonna continue trying with you because you just brought it on yourself.

Interviewer: And when you say stubborn, can you tell me more about that please?

Interviewee: Um… stubborn as in like say if they asked you multiple times like lets go, let’s do this, like wanting to make an effort to see you or bond with you, and you’re just saying no, I can’t be bothered or I’ve got- like making excuses all the time. So that’s- sometimes people would see that as someone just being like stubborn like not trying to make an effort [interviewer: mm] within their friendship and stuff.

Interviewer: ‘Kay. Um… so yeah. Essentially just not making the effort to meet with friends or even being stubborn, you know, can backfire, as you said [interviewee: mhm] and- and it can actually make you feel lonely. [Interviewee: mhm] You see your friends on- on- on somewhere- a picture or something, [interviewee: mhm] and then you feel like oh, I wish I would have- now- now you’re regretting it, essentially.

Interviewee: Mhm. Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay. And it makes you feel lonely and sad and you would ask yourself oh, why didn’t I- I should have contacted them and so on.

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Is there anything else you wanted to say?

Interviewee: No. Not about that.

Interviewer: Okay. Thank you.

Part 2:

Interviewer: Um… okay, so can we start by talking about what you put in the first box please.

Interviewee: Okay so in the first box I put youth clubs, um… friends’ houses and parties and like family moments. Um but I-

Interviewer: Which one do you feel most socially connected? Is it-

Interviewee: I feel more socially connected when I’m at like friends’ houses, when you have like- you know, when it’s just not you and your friend. When all the friends are over [interviewer: mhm] and you’re all together like having a catch-up or spending time together [interviewer: mhm] and yeah. Just all together, just like a normal day. That’s- personally I feel more like socially connected like that, because that’s- I’m with all my friends and yeah. But I also put youth club as well.

Interviewer: Sorry- friend’s house, is that within this neighbourhood here?

Interviewee: Yeah.

Interviewer: Okay.

Interviewee: Mhm. And I also put youth club, because that’s within my neighbourhood. But that’s something I used to do like throughout my child- like throughout when I was younger. Um… because they have many activities there like table tennis and all sorts and it kind- a youth club is a place where it keeps like young kids out of trouble because it’s open during the day and it gives them something to do [interviewer: mm] rather than being on the streets. So… I feel like it makes everyone there like all connect and like- socially and everything because it’s the same sort of children that go there, if you get what I mean? [Interviewer: mm] Yeah.

Interviewer: And, when you say like instead of being on the street, can you tell me about that?

Interviewee: Um, instead of being on the street, instead ‘cause young children- like teenagers like the sort of kids that go to youth club who are- they’re in their teens normally. And normally teenagers get into like trouble on the streets like get into gangs or… not all teenagers, but some teenagers, and a youth club’s a good place to like stop them because if they start going to the youth clubs, they’re not really gonna turn to the streets because they’re having fun there. Like they’re mind’s not on what’s happening on the streets. They have all their friends in the youth club so that’s where they wanna be.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel? How does it make you feel, being there?

Interviewee: It makes you feel welcome. It’s a happy place. Like it’s never sad, you’re never upset when you’re there. ‘Cause it’s just everything you wanna do, you’re with your friends, like you can drink, eat, it just makes you feel comfortable.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like you like that youth club because um… it makes you feel comfortable, being there with people, having- [interviewee: mhm] you have the opportunity to eat, um… and doing something that gets you off the streets for example. [Interviewee: yeah] Okay. Um… when you say like you go there, it gets you off the street, what is it about that place itself that- tell me about the place itself that encourages you to go.

Interviewee: It’s just the peop- the workers that’s there. They- they encourage us to go. That’s why. Um… [interviewer: mm] and they’re not really like- the workers connect well with the young children. Like, just the way they deal with them. Which makes them feel more welcome. Like they don’t treat them like they’re little kids. They treat them how they wanna be treated. And the kids usually like that. That’s why they go there more.

Interviewer: Mm. So basically it’s a welcoming place, [interviewee: mhm] people are treated nicely, um… tell me about the activities you do in there.

Interviewee: Do activities like um table tennis… um pool, um football- table football, sometimes they used the cage that’s in the area as well for football, basketball. And sometimes when- like in the summer, they used to go on trips, which you had to pay five pound for. But it would be five pound to go to like adventure island in south end or like far away trips in the summer. Or like lacer tag. So [interviewer: mm] they had lots of things to be honest.

Interviewer: Okay. Nice. And how did that make you feel, the- being involved in those activities?

Interviewee: Yeah it makes you feel welcome, like makes you- it makes you happy because you’re around people doing fun things and… yeah.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to say about that? Great. Well thank you so much. Can we talk about what you’ve put in box two please?

Interviewee: Um… in box two, for places where you feel most lonely, I put like um… say when you’re at home alone for a long period of time, like with no visitors, or like no one coming to see you, sometimes that can make someone feel lonely. ‘Cause [interviewer: mm] say if you’re- say if you’re on a break from work and you have no reason to really leave your house, but you’re expecting like oh yeah my friend- I got friends, they’ll probably come see me, but they don’t come to see you, like they just- you’re just there, not seeing anyone throughout your week or so that you have off of work. And… sometimes [interviewer: mm] that makes you feel lonely. [Interviewer: mm] You’d feel like oh, I might as well go to work, like sometimes people feel like what was the point of me having a day off work, I’m not even doing anything.

Interviewer: Mm. So it sounds like, you know, being in your room for a long period of time-

Interviewee: Mmh. It’s- I think that’s not good, personally. It’s good to like communicate and get out doors like… yeah.

Interviewer: How does that make you feel, being at home alone? [Interviewee: um…] For a long period of time.

Interviewee: Sometimes it’s just boring. You just feel- I feel- personally I feel bored, and like you’ll feel fed up with it, like oh I wanna go outside now.

Interviewer: Mm. So what you’re saying is, being at home and having no visitors um…. makes you feel bored at home.

Interviewee: Yeah, sometimes. It depends what you do. It depends what sort of things you do by yourself. ‘Casue some people struggle to entertain theirself, some people don’t enjoy their own company. But some people like do enjoy their own company. Like me, I will enjoy my own company for a certain amount of time, but after a while I’ll get bored of it and I’ll think ‘kay let me go call someone and see what they’re doing because I’m bored of being here now.

Interviewer: When you say some people may not like their own company, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Like… um some people might find it hard… um hard to entertain theirself, being alone. So say, when I’m alone, I would listen to music and like tidy up or something and… I find that sometimes fun for myself. ‘Cause I like- I enjoy listening to music, so I’ll entertain myself listening to music or doing work or something. Or my- like friends will come here. But some people, when they’re like alone- obviously my friends- we’re talking- I’m talking about entertaining yourself and I’m talking about friends coming. I mean… but some people like won’t like listening to music, so they won’t have nothing to really do at home. They might not play computer games either, watch TV, so they won’t have any sort of way of entertaining theirself.

Interviewer: Mm. And when- but so for example you mentioned earlier that you have you phone, which you um basically, you can use to communicate to others and [interviewee: mhm] know what’s going on. [Interviewee: yeah] So… tell me more about that. When you’re at home and-

Interviewee: Yeah, when I’m at home, if I get bored of being with my own company, I would message someone or call them and I would say like what are you doing, let’s meet up or something. And then we’ll just… I would just be with someone so I won’t be alone.

Interviewer: Mm. Alright. Um… is there anything else you wanted to say about that box?

Interviewee: Um. Yeah, I’ll talk about um… an- being in an office or library could make you feel lonely sometimes. Say if you’re at work in an office, sometimes it’s not- it depends where you’re working- sometimes it’s not nice to work in an office all day. Some people might not even communicate. Some people like… could just be working and be in silence and some people might feel lonely and… fed up of that boring, dull, dark atmosphere. Like just sile- just working. Staring at your computer, typing all day with no sort of communication. [Interviewer: mm] That- in a work place, personally if there were lots of people around and no one communicated with me, I would feel lonely. If that happened to me.

Interviewer: Mm. Being at work [interviewee: yeah] and no one communicating with you. [Interviewee: mhm] How would that make you feel?

Interviewee: Um… left out. If I could see them communicating with others. Um… sometimes it would just make you feel like fed up of the job, like- [interviewer: mm] or don’t wanna be here, I wanna be- you just think of other places where you wanna be. And just yeah.

Interviewer: Hmm. So it makes you feel fed up, sort of not being able to participate in some sort of group relationships and so on. [Interviewee: yeah] Um… okay. So being at work or being in any sort of gathering, and if other people are sort of with each other and talking [interviewee: mhm] and what not and you’re kind of on your own, [interviewee: yeah] it makes you feel kind of lonely and…

Interviewee: Yeah, because like- I said like about the other boxes, um seeing people communicate and you being there, not communicating with them, would make you feel- like question yourself, as to like if people like you or not.

Interviewer: Mm. When you say like… you would question yourself whether people like you or not, can you tell me more about that?

Interviewee: Um, question yourself because… um…. you seeing other people communicate and having fun and whatever would make you feel-

Interruption

Interviewee: Anyway, yeah. So-

Interviewer: Sorry, let me just repeat the question. So if you basically- uh when you said like, you know, you would question yourself and then so on, [interviewee: yeah] can you tell me more about that.

Interviewee: You would question yourself because other people around you communicating, and you’re there alone. You would think… why is no one communicating with me? What did I do? Like you’re just- lots of questions would just come in your head as to why they’re not communicating with you.

Interviewer: Mm. And how does that make you feel in that moment?

Interviewee: Um… it would make you not wanna be there. Like probably make you wanna leave the room or wherever you are to like not feel like left out in here, or see the people all together.

Interviewer: Mm. Okay. Is there anything else you wanted to say? ‘Kay cool, thank you very much.
