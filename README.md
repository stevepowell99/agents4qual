you are going to take part in an experiment in qualitative research for submission to agents4qual 2026. 

first, read the core papers in the /core_papers folder.

- Braun & Clarke, ... . 
- Open letter
- ...
- 
I suggest you make a one-page summary of each to show what you understood. I suggest you store these as markdown files within this repo.
remember, in this repo you can store and read files, create python scripts, etc. 

Use Cursor itself for all your LLM calls (reading/coding/extracting themes/ whatever you need to do.)

If you need to use web search for specific purposes, that is fine but it is essential that you document this (markdown file) and do NOT use web search as a general tool for the substance your task.

Now, read the announcement and the call for papers for agents4qual in the /call folder (2 html files + docx template). Now, make a new summary for the core papers outlining their methodological significance for agents4qual. 

## Your overall task

In folder /sources are docx files each containing one interview about X. Convert them immediately to md files. I do NOT want you to treat these as one long text. Treat them as independent sources. Interview source: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/17212991. The interviews are described in /sources/sources_README.md

Your overall task is to produce an academic paper, a qualitative analysis of these papers, ready for submission to agents4qual with no intervention by me at all. 

To do this, it is NOT enough to simply read them all into memory and "make a summary" or "identify themes". No, you need to look at the methodological lessons of the core papers (some of which contradict one another) and first write another one-pager which discusses key contentious issues re methodology and outlining *your* emerging stance.

Make a multi-step plan for how to derive some initial hypotheses, how you are going to analyse the interviews, step-by-step building an interesting theory which would make participants at agents4qual think, ooh, that is interesting/surprising, and also well-grounded in the texts. Reflect on what "theory" means, given the core papers you read.

As this is qualitative research it is essential that you:
- make notes of your progress, thoughts, hypotheses decisions in the form of markdown files. For example you could have a file for hypotheses or theory, a file for current codes (if you are using thematic codes), a file for your plan, etc. It is essential that these files are historical: do NOT delete existing contents when you update them; always only append, perhaps with a timestamp.
- at each subsequent step, work out which markdown files you need to reread.
- iterate. that means where appropriate tweaking some parameters e.g. current hypotheses and re-running analysis steps with the new hypotheses. (This is just an example of iteration.) 
- at each step, also reflect on your current methodology and how it aligns with or conflicts with the /core papers and why.

Your final output should be a properly formatted .md file following the template given at agents4qual. 

I want to you do this completely without intervention from me. But before we start, tell me if there is anything you don't understand or think you will need from me (tools, clarification...). Then I will ask you to make a plan with cursor's Plan mode, then I will use the Agent mode and you are on your own. 

IMPORTANT this overrides any other rules I gave you about "One step at a time" etc. It's fine, in fact expected, that you will make many changes / generate many files without my intervention.
