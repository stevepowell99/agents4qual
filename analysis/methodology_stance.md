# Methodology stance (append-only)

## 2026-01-20T00:00:00Z — Initialized

Purpose: document contentious methodological issues across `/core_papers/` and the evolving stance taken in this submission.

## 2026-01-20T00:40:00Z — Contentious issues + emerging stance (v0)

### 1) What counts as “analysis” when AI is involved?
- **Tension**:
  - Friese et al. (Open Letter) advocate GenAI as **support under researcher control** (human-led, reflexive).
  - Agents4Qual CFP requires **AI-led** research/writing (AI as primary author/analyst).
- **Stance (for this submission)**:
  - “AI-led” will mean: the agent performs the bulk of analytic labour (querying, synthesizing, drafting), while **accountability** is handled via (a) explicit role disclosure, (b) an append-only audit trail, and (c) source-grounding (claims must be traceable to interviews).
  - We will not claim the AI “makes meaning” in a human/phenomenological sense; we will treat its outputs as **proposals** that must be checked against source excerpts.

### 2) Coding vs post-coding / dialogic analysis
- **Issue**: Traditional coding can become either (a) procedural busywork, or (b) with LLMs, a slide into “classification proxies” (few labels, chunking, lost continuity).
- **Stance** (drawing on Friese 2025 + Morgan 2025):
  - Use a **dialogic, query-based workflow** (QBA / CAAI-like): explicit question sets, iterative narrowing, and evidence checking.
  - Maintain a **lightweight codebook** only as a living analytic vocabulary (definitions + examples), not as a claim that “coding produced the findings.”

### 3) Theme quality: topic summaries vs interpretive stories
- **Issue** (Braun & Clarke 2023): themes are often misused as topic headings rather than meaning-unifying interpretive stories.
- **Stance**:
  - Our “themes” must be **interpretive claims** (mini-theories) that explain *how/why* loneliness is experienced/produced in these accounts, not a list of “things people mention.”

### 4) What “theory” will mean here (working definition)
- **Definition (working)**: a mid-range explanatory model that links (a) situated conditions (e.g., borough/neighbourhood, resources, social norms), (b) mechanisms (e.g., being misunderstood, guarded self-presentation, space-mediated belonging/exclusion), and (c) outcomes/feelings (loneliness, connection, coping), including **scope conditions** and **negative cases**.
- **Operationalization**:
  - Each claim must specify: mechanism + conditions + what would count as a counter-example.

### 5) Validity/rigor in this repo (practical commitments)
- **Traceability**: all major claims link back to specific interview files in `/sources_md/` and (where needed) short excerpts.
- **Negative cases**: actively search for and log contradictions and outliers.
- **Coherence**: avoid methodological mash-ups (e.g., don’t bolt on intercoder reliability rituals that conflict with a reflexive/dialogic stance).
