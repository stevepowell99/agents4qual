Toward good practice in thematic analysis: Avoiding common problems 
and be(com)ing a knowing researcher
In response to the increasing use of thematic analysis 
(TA), and particularly the TA approach we have devel-
oped, in qualitative and mixed methods research pub-
lished in IJTH, the editors of the journal have invited 
us to provide a commentary on good practice and com-
mon problems in TA research. The aim of this com-
mentary is to guide researchers in producing and 
reporting methodologically coherent TA and reviewers 
in assessing what constitutes good practice, and ulti-
mately to support IJTH in publishing high quality TA. 
This commentary is based on a review of 20 papers 
published in IJTH citing our work 1—typically Braun and 
Clarke ( 2006), the paper in which we first outlined our 
TA approach—with most authors claiming to have “fol-
lowed” our approach, and a minority citing our work 
but using other approaches. It’s important to stress that 
our goal here is not to encourage or enforce strict adher -
ence to the procedures we have outlined—or what has 
been dubbed methodolatry (Chamberlain, 2000) or pro -
ceduralism (King & Brooks, 2018), where procedures are 
prioritized over reflexivity and theoretical sensitivity. 
Rather, we want to encourage what we call knowing  
practice of TA. A knowing researcher is one who strives 
to “own” their perspectives (Elliott et  al., 1999), both 
personal and theoretical, is deliberative in their 
decision-making, and reflexive in their practice of TA.
The 20 papers we reviewed provide an interesting 
“snapshot” of TA research in the field of transgender 
health research. Most papers reported qualitative stud-
ies—with the rest mixed-method designs—typically based 
on interview, focus group or qualitative survey data. 
Most exemplified an experiential orientation to qualita-
tive research, with a focus on the lived experience and 
perspectives of transgender folx (and some interest in 
the views of others, such of parents of transgender ado-
lescents), or the factors that influence and contextualize 
certain behaviors and choices, underpinned by a realist 
or critical realist ontology. We were heartened that some 
researchers in the field of transgender health are also 
using TA to interrogate the social construction of mean-
ing within a critical orientation to qualitative research 
(for further discussion of the experiential/critical dis -
tinction, see Braun & Clarke, 2022b). The idea that 
TA—or indeed qualitative research—just offers a window 
into experience is unfortunately too common, when the 
full potential is far wider.
In our critical review, we highlight three important 
issues (1) the, often unacknowledged, diversity within 
TA and many researchers’ tendency to, paraphrasing 
Marecek (2003), “swim unknowingly in the waters of 
positivism”; (2) confusing themes-as-meaning-unifie
d-interpretative-stories with themes-as-topic-summaries; 
and (3) (not) owning one’s perspective.
TA is a family of methods, not a singular 
method—there is no “standardised TA”!
An important step on the path to knowing TA practice 
is appreciating the diversity within TA and understanding 
what type of TA you are practising. Some of the papers 
reviewed implicitly or explicitly presented TA as a sin-
gular method (e.g., through references to “standardised 
TA ”), whereas TA is better thought of as a family  of 
methods. To capture some of the diversity within the 
TA family, we have developed a typology of similar 
approaches, which we designate coding reliability, code-
book and reflexive TA, and thematic coding (for our 
most detailed discussion, see Braun & Clarke, 2022b). 
These approaches have some things in common: practices 
of coding and theme development; the possibility of 
capturing semantic and/or latent meaning, and orienting 
to data inductively and/or deductively; and the designa-
tion of TA as a theoretically flexible method, 2 rather 
than a theoretically informed and delimited methodology. 
However, they differ in the enactment of coding and 
theme development, underlying research values, and the 
conceptualization of key concepts such as the theme. 
Procedural differences should not be dismissed as trivial, 
as they reflect underlying research values. We found 
Kidder and Fine (1987) small q/Big Q qualitative dis-
tinction useful when developing our typology. We also 
like Finlay’s more recent (2021) distinction between sci-
entifically descriptive (small q, positivist) and artfully 
interpretive (Big Q, non-positivist, reflexive) TA.
Small q qualitative research reflects the use of tech-
niques of qualitative data collection and analysis within 
a framework of (post)positivism—in many disciplines,

including our discipline of psychology, this is the dom-
inant values framework for research. Coding reliability 
TA is an example of small q or positivist qualitative, as 
it emphasizes procedures for ensuring the objectivity, 
reliability or accuracy of coding and keeping “researcher 
bias” in check (e.g., such as through the use of structured 
codebooks, multiple coders who independently code the 
same data, the calculation of intercoder agreement and 
consensus coding).
Big Q qualitative involves the use of techniques of 
qualitative data generation and analysis within a 
non-positivist framework informed by qualitative research 
values. There is no one  set of research values that all 
qualitative researchers agree on, but many emphasize 
researcher subjectivity as a resource for research, rather 
than a threat to be contained, and meaning and knowl-
edge as contextually situated, partial and provisional. Big 
Q researchers typically conceptualize mind-dependent  
truths, rather than a mind-independent  truth (Tebes, 
2005). Our approach, which we now call reflexive TA to 
acknowledge the plurality of TA and better distinguish 
it from other approaches (see Braun & Clarke, 2019), is 
an example of a Big Q or non-positivist qualitative 
approach (other reflexive approaches include Hayes, 
2000; Langdridge, 2004). Reflexive TA approaches 
embrace researcher subjectivity as a resource for research 
(rejecting positivist notions of researcher bias, see Varpio 
et  al., 2021), view the practice of TA as inherently sub-
jective, emphasize researcher reflexivity, and reject the 
notion that coding can ever be accurate—as it is an 
inherently interpretative practice, and meaning is not 
fixed within data.
Codebook approaches to TA—such as framework 
(Gale et  al., 2013) or template (King & Brooks, 2018) 
analysis—combine some of the more structured proce-
dures of coding reliability TA 3 with some of the quali-
tative research values of reflexive TA. Finally, thematic 
coding involves the use of grounding theory coding 
procedures to develop themes from data. Although the-
matic coding remains in use—including in a few of the 
papers in our review 4—and discussed in some method-
ological texts (e.g., Flick, 2018 ; Rivas, 2018 ), it was more 
common before TA was widely recognized as a dis-
tinct method.
Methodological incoherence beckons when researchers 
seemingly unknowingly mash together different 
approaches to TA (see Braun & Clarke, 2022a). There 
were several examples in the papers we reviewed of 
researchers using Big Q reflexive TA approach and pro-
cedures, with conceptually incoherent additions, such as 
small q consensus coding and measuring intercoder 
agreement, or adding a codebook development/recoding 
the data phase, or referencing both positivist notions of 
researcher bias and Big Q notions of reflexivity, or 
expressing concern for the accuracy and objectivity of 
the coding or the potential for misinterpreting the data 
(implying that correct interpretation is possible). The 
papers evidenced little recognition of the potential for 
methodological incoherence when drawing on concepts 
and procedures from both positivist/small q and 
non-positivist/Big Q TA/qualitative research, or any jus-
tification or rationale for these “mash-ups. ” In pointing 
this out, we’re not arguing that analytic procedures 
should be followed precisely like baking recipes, and 
that this is what constitutes good research. Rather, a 
knowing TA researcher would acknowledge their diver -
gence from established procedures, including conceptual 
incoherence, and provide a rationale  for their innovative 
approach. It’s not the case that “anything goes” in TA 
research, as the procedures have broad paradigmatic and 
conceptual foundations. Researchers cannot coherently 
be both a descriptive scientist and an interpretative artist 
(Finlay, 2021). The procedures we and other TA meth-
odologists have developed are thought-through manifes-
tations of underlying research values, meaning divergences 
and mash-ups should be equally thoughtful.
Telling meaning-united stories or 
summarizing topics?
Another divergence across the TA family of methods 
relates to the conceptualization of themes and whether 
themes are understood as a) summaries of topics or 
categories (what is shared and unites the observations 
in the theme is the topic, such as “good experiences in 
healthcare”); or b) capturing a core idea or meaning 
(what is shared and unites the observations in the theme 
is meaning), and the telling of an interpretative story 
about it. This latter type of theme can draw together 
data connected to even seemingly unrelated topics, if 
the core idea or meaning is evident. Topic summaries 
as themes are common in coding reliability and some 
codebook TA, and thematic coding; themes in reflexive, 
and some codebook, TA are conceptualized as 
meaning-based, interpretative stories. But these concep-
tualisations often don’t map onto what happens in prac-
tice. Topic summary themes are so widely used in 
reflexive TA that we have identified this as the most 
“common problem” in reflexive TA (see Braun & Clarke, 
2021a)—alongside what we call “positivism creep, ” where 
positivism slips unknowingly into reflexive TA (through 
the use of concepts like researcher bias; see Braun & 
Clarke, 2022b). Both problems—positivism creep, and 
the use of topic summary themes in reflexive TA—were 
evident in the papers we reviewed. For us, the distinction 
between these two “types” of theme is very clear, but 
we know researchers sometimes struggle with the dis-
tinction. So, if you’re doing reflexive TA, how might you 
check if your theme is a topic summary or a 
meaning-based interpretive story? If you could conceiv-
ably have developed this theme before  analyzing your 
data, or if it maps closely on to a data collection ques-
tion, then it is quite likely to be a topic summary.

Similarly, if it summarizes the different or main things 
participants said about a particular issue or topic. Theme 
names can suggest a topic summary through, for instance, 
a one-word name that identifies the topic, such as 
“Doctors, ” or something like “Experiences of…, ” “Barriers 
to…, ” “Influences on…, ” suggesting diverse experiences, 
barriers and influences will be discussed (sometimes 
meaning-based themes may just be badly named, see 
Braun & Clarke, 2022b). By contrast, themes as inter -
pretative stories built around uniting meaning cannot be 
developed in advance of analysis. They contain diversity, 
but they have a central idea that unifies the diversity 
(instead of “good experiences of healthcare” you might 
have the theme “validation of my personhood”).
Two of the reviewed papers provided clear examples 
of themes as meaning-based interpretative stories. Fraser 
et  al. (2021) explored transgender adults’ experiences of 
gender affirming healthcare readiness assessments in New 
Zealand. In contrast to most of the papers reviewed, 
which reported higher numbers of themes and sub-
themes, Fraser et  al. reported two themes: proving gender  
and the trans narrative . Proving gender  centered around 
participants’ experiences of the assessment process as an 
aversive gatekeeping practice designed to test whether 
they were adequately or truly trans. The trans narrative  
centered around the pressure participants felt—because 
of the testing if they were “properly trans” character of 
the assessment process—to present their gender in a 
particular way, in order to gain access to gender affirm-
ing healthcare. The trans narrative required a binary 
trans identity, knowing they were trans from a very 
young age and wanting “full” medical transition. 
Frohard-Dourlent et  al. (2020) explored experiences of 
surgical readiness assessments in Canada and reported 
three themes and seven sub-themes 1) Assessments as 
gatekeeping (incorporating three subthemes: assessments 
as outdated and irrelevant; power asymmetry undermin-
ing care; assessments as discriminatory); 2) Assessments 
as a barrier to care (subthemes: assessments as confusing; 
and inaccessible); and 3) Assessments as useful (sub-
themes: assessments as effective and clarifying; and 
affirming). Similar to experiences reported by Fraser 
et  al., participants often experienced the assessment pro-
cess as aversive gatekeeping, with health professionals 
having the power to deny access to care, and compel 
conformity to an archetypal and outdated binary trans 
narrative. Assessments were experienced as difficult to 
access because of opaqueness, bureaucracy and a lack of 
socio-economic privilege. Assessment were also con-
versely experienced as positive by some, with participants 
feeling supported by the assessor and prepared for the 
next steps. Frohard-Dourlent et  al. also provide an exam-
ple of a clear overview of the thematic structure (in the 
form of a table), and a brief but effective account of the 
authors’ analytic process and engagement with reflexive 
TA, both important elements of a high-quality TA report 
(Braun & Clarke, 2022b).
Why does this distinction between topic summary 
and meaning-based interpretive story themes matter, and 
why is it a problem if researchers use reflexive TA but 
produce a set of topic summaries? Simply put, topic 
summaries make no conceptual sense in reflexive TA, 
and the procedures have been designed to support the 
development of deep understanding and the telling of 
interpretative stories about meanings (sometimes obvious, 
sometimes subtle) that cut across a dataset and capture 
an important aspect of whatever you are trying to under -
stand! The practice requires depth of engagement, think-
ing creatively and reflexively about the data, an intensive 
and organic coding process designed to parse out dif-
ferent facets of data meaning, and to help the researcher 
move beyond the most obvious or superficial meanings 
in the data. There is little point engaging in this labo-
rious (but hopefully rewarding) process to then summa-
rize data under headings that could have been determined 
before beginning the analysis. If your goal is  to develop 
a set of topic summary type themes, select an approach, 
determined by your research values, that has that as its 
analytic purpose. Both coding reliability and some code-
book approaches conceptualize themes as topic summa-
ries (template analysis notably allows for the possibility 
of developing themes during or from coding). They are 
developed early in the analytic process, sometimes lifted 
from data collection questions, and coding is a process 
for allocating data to these early/pre-determined themes.
(Not) owning one’s perspective
The papers we reviewed exemplified both good and bad 
practice with regard to researchers striving to own their 
perspective. All included some kind of statement of the 
researchers’ personal positioning and/or professional 
experience with regard to gender identity, which is par -
ticularly important when researching socially minoritized 
groups and when researchers may be more socially pow -
erful and privileged outsiders. However, reflexivity rarely 
extended beyond this more personal framing (Wilkinson, 
1988). Reflexive practice, which goes beyond  a “shopping 
list” of identities (Folkes, 2022), is particularly important 
for reflexive TA. We look forward to reading more 
instances of researchers linking their personal positioning 
to their analytic process and more detailed discussions 
of how researchers engaged in reflexivity, and how this 
shaped the analysis they produced (for excellent examples 
of this, see Ho et  al., 2017; Trainor & Bundon, 2021). 
Language around theme development is also important 
to signal the researcher’s active  role in generating their 
themes (and also to clearly signal that themes are not 
implicitly conceptualized as real things that exist within 
data prior to analysis). In reflexive TA, themes are gen-
erated, created or constructed (for example), they are not 
identified, found or discovered, and they definitely don’t 
just “emerge” from data like a fully-grown Venus arising

from the sea and arriving at the shore in Botticelli’s 
famous painting (see Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2016).
Reflexivity, personal or otherwise, is one aspect of a 
researcher striving to own their perspectives; discussing 
and coherently enacting their theoretical assumptions is 
another. Some of the papers we reviewed included a 
statement of the theoretical assumptions informing the 
use of TA. But some didn’t. Because TA is better under -
stood as closer to a method than a methodology, and 
because of its theoretical flexibility, it’s vital that research-
ers locate their use of TA theoretically (see Braun & 
Clarke, 2022a, 2022b). TA cannot be conducted in a 
theoretical vacuum—researchers inescapably bring in 
assumptions about the nature of reality, about what con-
stitutes meaningful knowledge and knowledge produc-
tion, and what their data represent or give them access 
to, even if these are not discussed. Ideally, the reader 
should not be left to detect what the researcher’s assump-
tions are—they would explicitly be discussed in the 
paper. We originally stated that reflexive TA could be 
underpinned by (simple) realism (Braun & Clarke, 2006), 
but we now think the Big Q research values of reflexive 
TA make a simple or naive realist reflexive TA a tricky 
proposition. This raises questions about whether widely 
used realist/positivist quality practices, like saturation, 
triangulation and member checking (see Varpio et  al., 
2017), all referenced in the reviewed papers and in pub-
lished TA more broadly, are coherent with reflexive TA.
We’ll use member checking or participant validation of 
analysis to explore this—where participants are asked to 
input on whether an analysis faithfully or fairly represents 
their experience. This practice in theory controls for or 
corrects any subjective bias—misinterpretation, misempha-
sis—of the researcher (Smith & McGannon, 2018). 
Ethically/politically, this practice is unquestionably import-
ant when researching and claiming to represent the expe-
riences of socially marginalized groups, especially so if 
the researchers are all privileged “outsiders” to that group, 
as is often the case for trans health research. However, 
the use of member checking is infused with assumptions 
about reality and knowledge production that sit (concep-
tually) uncomfortably with reflexive TA—including that 
there is a truth of participants’ experiences that we can 
access if we can keep the potentially distorting effects of 
researcher influence in check (see Smith & McGannon, 
2018). Reflexive TA is premised on the researcher always 
shaping their research; it will always be infused with their 
subjectivity, and they are never a neutral conduit, simply 
conveying a directly-accessed truth of participants’ expe-
rience. Tracy (2010) highlighted the concept of member 
reflections as a Big Q alternative to member checking, 
which is not about verification, or accessing truth or real-
ity. With this process, participants are invited to reflect 
on the analysis to offer additional insight and generate 
further data on the topic at hand. This can mean exploring 
gaps in understanding, recognizing and reflecting on con -
tradictions and differences in understanding, and 
considering how to acknowledge and present these in the 
written report (see Smith & McGannon, 2018). Within a 
wide diversity of Indigenous and participatory approaches 
(e.g., Barlo et  al., 2020; Cammock et  al., 2021; Fine et  al., 
2021; Ware et  al., 2018), differently-conceptualized rela-
tionships between “researchers” and “participants, ” and/or 
understandings of (the purpose of) knowledge and the 
(primary) obligations and purposes of research, also render 
considerations of “member-checking” quite differently from 
more conventional western frameworks of (qualitative) 
knowledge production.
The key to selecting methodologically coherent quality 
standards and tools is knowing  practice—reasoning 
through the assumptions embedded in particular con-
cepts and practices. Luckily, qualitative methodologists 
have already done a lot of the heavy lifting here (e.g., 
Braun & Clarke, 2021b ; Smith & McGannon, 2018; 
Varpio et  al., 2017, 2021), presenting thoughtful consid-
erations of what’s assumed and at stake in various sup-
posedly universal criteria. Y our task is to think, and 
reflect, and ensure any quality measures you use are 
coherent with your approach to TA and underpinning 
theoretical assumptions.
Ten recommendations for producing and 
reporting methodologically coherent TA and 
being a knowing TA researcher
We now distill this commentary into ten snappy recom-
mendations for TA researchers to help with producing 
and reporting methodologically coherent TA. We encour -
age reviewers to use these recommendations to inform 
their assessments of TA manuscripts. These should not 
be treated a checklist in the narrow sense, but as import-
ant things to reflect on, and reason through—consider 
them provocations for knowing practice.
1. Recognize the plurality of TA; determine where 
your chosen TA approach is located on the sci-
entifically descriptive (small q)—artfully interpre -
tive (Big Q) spectrum.
2. Determine your underlying research values and 
philosophical assumptions; locate your use of TA 
theoretically.
3. Consider your analytic practice; ensure all meth-
odological procedures and concepts cohere with 
your research values and TA approach.
4. Justify divergences from established practice and 
“mashups;” ensure these are theoretically 
coherent.
5. If using reflexive TA, link personal reflexivity to 
your analytic practice; don’t mention bias.
6. Discuss how exactly you engaged with your cho-
sen approach to produce your analysis.
7. Recognize the differences between topic summary 
and meaning-based interpretative story

conceptualisations of themes; ensure your type of 
theme is coherent with your TA approach (and 
justify any divergences).
8. Ensure your language around theme development 
is coherent with your TA approach.
9. Provide a clear overview of your themes/thematic 
structure in the form of a list, table or thematic map.
10. Ensure the quality standards and practices used 
cohere with your TA approach and underlying 
theoretical assumptions.
Everything changes…
We end with a final recommendation for readers wanting 
to pursue good practice in reflexive TA—read beyond our 
2006 paper! Our thinking around TA has evolved since 
2006, including now using the specific name reflexive TA 
(Braun & Clarke, 2019). Our recent book Thematic anal -
ysis: A practical guide  (Braun & Clarke, 2022b) provides 
the most comprehensive guidance for both doing reflexive 
TA, and thinking about TA. We have developed a web-
site—www.thematicanalysis.net—which links to all of the 
resources we have produced. We have published numerous 
papers addressing, among other things, misconceptions 
and confusions around reflexive TA (Braun & Clarke, 
2021a), whether saturation is a meaningful concept for 
reflexive TA (TL; DR no it isn’t!; Braun & Clarke, 2021b), 
designing methodologically coherent TA research (Braun 
& Clarke, 2022a), and when and why to use reflexive TA 
(Braun & Clarke, 2021c). We particularly encourage 
reviewers to read the tool for evaluating TA manuscripts 
for publication in Braun and Clarke (2021a).
Notes
 1. As we are discussing bad practice and have no wish to 
“name and shame” authors, we have chosen not to include 
a list of papers reviewed and only reference examples of 
bad practice in general terms. However, as we also recognise 
the value of concrete examples, we do identify the authors 
of two papers that exemplify good practice in various ways.
 2. TA was occasionally described as a methodology in the 
papers reviewed—we don’t think it fulfils all of the require-
ments of a methodology because it doesn’t inherently pro-
vide researchers with a theoretically-informed framework 
for research. Unlike methodologies such as grounded the-
ory or discourse analysis, TA offers few directives around 
philosophical and theoretical positioning, appropriate re-
search questions, data collection methods, or the size or 
constitution of the participant group/dataset (see Braun & 
Clarke, 2022a). Therefore, we think TA is better understood 
as closer to a method. We say closer to  because the proce-
dures and conceptualisations of key concepts associated with 
different iterations of TA reflect particular underlying par -
adigmatic assumptions or research values.
 3. In line with qualitative values, codebooks are more used to 
chart the developing analysis, instead of being a tool to 
measure whether coding is reliable.
 4. One paper justified the use of grounded theory coding 
techniques to do TA on the grounds that Braun and Clarke 
(2006) don’t provide a plan for doing TA. Given that the 
purpose of our 2006 paper was precisely to do that, and it 
was the first place we outlined a clear six-phase approach 
to reflexive TA—and critiqued the use of grounded theory 
techniques to do TA—this stands as one of the many spu-
rious claims that exist about TA (see Braun & Clarke, 
2021a). We are troubled how such basically incorrect in-
formation survives the peer review and editorial process.
