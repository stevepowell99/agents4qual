# Excerpts log (append-only)

Purpose: store verbatim excerpts (short quotes) from specific interviews, tagged with codes/themes and a brief analytic note. This is our primary traceability mechanism for reflexive thematic analysis.

Rule: never delete or overwrite prior entries; only append new dated sections.

## Tagging convention
- `[src:Interview_XX_*.md]` (required)
- `[meta:borough=... age=.. gender=..]` (required)
- `[code:...]` (one or more; provisional and revisable)
- `[theme:...]` (optional; use when linking excerpt to an emerging theme/story)
- `[supports]` or `[contradicts]` (required relative to the current theory claims)
- `[note:...]` (required; 1–3 sentences: why this excerpt matters)
