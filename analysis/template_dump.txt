Citations, figures, tables, footnotes
In-text citations
Use APA style (7th edition) for in-text citations
Use the author–date format.
Example: (Smith, 2021)
When you quote directly, include the page number.
Example: (Smith, 2021, p. 45)
If the author’s name appears in your sentence, only include the year in parentheses.
Example: Smith (2021) found that...
For two authors, include both names with an ampersand.
Example: (Smith & Jones, 2020)
For three or more authors, use the first author’s name followed by et al.
Example: (Brown et al., 2019)
When citing multiple sources together, list them alphabetically and separate with semicolons.
Example: (Brown, 2019; Smith, 2021; Taylor, 2020)
For organizations as authors, spell out the name the first time, then abbreviate if well known.
Example: (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020) and later (WHO, 2020)

Figures and Tables
Use APA style (7th edition)
Number each in the order they appear in the text: Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, Figure 2.
Title goes in italics, in title case, placed above tables and below figures.
Include a note below if needed to explain abbreviations or details.
Always refer to each table or figure in the text (for example, “see Table 2”).
Keep them simple, clear, and self-explanatory. Readers should understand them without reading the text.
Use consistent fonts (same as the main text) and avoid vertical lines in tables.
If reproduced or adapted from another source, include a copyright note and full citation in the reference list.

Footnotes
Footnotes should be used sparingly. If you do require a footnote, indicate footnotes with a number in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear. 
References
Use APA style (7th edition) for references
Start on a new page titled References (header 1).
List entries alphabetically by the first author’s last name.
Use hanging indents (first line flush left, rest indented).
Follow the author–date–title–source order.
Example for a journal article:
Smith, J. A., & Brown, L. M. (2021). Understanding AI in research. Journal of Data Studies, 12(3), 45–60.
Include DOIs or URLs when available, written as links (no “Retrieved from”).
For books, include the publisher name but not the location.
Example: Jones, P. (2020). Thinking with Data. Oxford University Press.
